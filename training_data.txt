Hero! This Woman Finally Worked Up The Courage To Look At Her Issue Backlog
"Bullet Point Issue Closing Comment Actually Worse Than Going Stale:
When I was in graduate school in Ann Arbor, I had a friend who was deeply involved with the environmentalist movement. He purchased his food from local farmers‚Äô markets, and he commuted by bike instead of by car to reduce his carbon footprint, and he maintained a horrid compost bin that will probably be the origin of the next flu pandemic. One day, he told me that he was going to visit a farm for a week. I asked him why, and he said that he wanted to ‚Äúget closer to the land,‚Äù a phrase that you can only say with a straight face if you‚Äôre narrating a documentary about ancient South American tribes. I told my friend that the land didn‚Äôt want to get closer to him, and if he really looked at the land, he‚Äôd see that it was not composed of delicious organic trail mix, but famine and vultures and backbreaking labor involving wheelbarrows and generally unacceptable quantities of insects. He responded with an extended lecture about eco-responsibility, a lecture that I immediately forgot because I realized that my na√Øve friend was going to die on that farm. So, I told my friend that he shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to end his trip early if he wasn‚Äôt having a good time. He smiled at me, the way that people in slasher movies smile before they get chopped up, and he left for the farm. Precisely 37 hours later, he called me on the phone. I asked him how everything was going, and he made a haunting, elegiac noise, like a foghorn calling out for its mate. I asked him to describe his first day, and he said that his entire existence revolved around bleating things: bleating goats that wanted to be fed, and bleating crows that wanted to steal the food that he gave the bleating goats, and bleating farm machines that were composed of spinning metal blades and had no discernable purpose besides enrolling you in the ‚ÄúHook Hand of the Month‚Äù club. I asked my friend when he was coming back home, and he said that he was calling me from the Ann Arbor train station; he had already returned. And then he let out that foghorn noise, that awful, lingering sound, and I thought, MAYBE THAT‚ÄôS THE FIRST SYMPTOM OF COMPOST BIN FLU.Computer scientists often look at Web pages in the same way that my friend looked at farms. People think that Web browsers are elegant computation platforms, and Web pages are light, f luffy things that you can edit in Notepad as you trade ironic comments with your friends in the coffee shop. Nothing could be further from the truth. A modern Web page is a catastrophe. It‚Äôs like a scene from one of those apocalyptic medieval paintings that depicts what would happen if Galactus arrived: people are tumbling into fiery crevasses and lamenting various lamentable things and hanging from playground equipment that would not pass OSHA safety checks. This kind of stuff is exactly what you‚Äôll see if you look at the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a modern Web page. Of course, no human can truly ‚Äúlook‚Äù at this content, because a Web page is now like V‚ÄôGer from the first ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù movie, a piece of technology that we once understood but can no longer fathom, a thrashing leviathan of code and markup written by people so untrustworthy that they‚Äôre not even third parties, they‚Äôre fifth parties who weren‚Äôt even INVITED to the party, but who showed up anyways because the hippies got it right and free love or whatever. I‚Äôm pretty sure that the Web browser is one of the ‚Äúdens of iniquity‚Äù that I keep hearing about on Fox News; I would verify this using a Web search, but a Web search would require me to use a browser, AND THIS IS EX ACTLY WHAT BICOASTAL LIBER AL ELITES WANT ME TO DO.

Describing why the Web is horrible is like describing why it‚Äôs horrible to drown in an ocean composed of pufferfish that are pregnant with tiny Freddy Kruegers‚Äîeach detail is horrendous in isolation, but the aggregate sum is delightfully arranged into a hate f lower that blooms all year. For example, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) provides ‚Äúofficial‚Äù  specificationsfor many client-side Web technologies. Unfortunately, these specifications are binding upon browser vendors in the same way that you can ask a Gila monster to meet you at the airport, but that gila monster may, in fact, have better things to do.  Each W3C document is filled with alienating sentences that largely consist of hyperlinks to different hyperlinks.
Given the unbearable proliferation of Web standards, and the comically ill-expressed semantics of those standards, browser vendors should just give up and tell society to stop asking for such ridiculous things. However, this opinion is unpopular, because nobody will watch your TED talk if your sense of optimism is grounded in reality. I frequently try to explain to my friends why they should abandon Web pages and exchange information using sunlight ref lected from mirrors, or the enthusiastic waving of colored flags. My friends inevitably respond with a spiritually vacant affirmation like, ‚ÄúPeople invented flying machines, so we can certainly make a good browser!‚Äù Unfortunately, defining success for a flying machine is easy (‚ÄúI‚ÄôM ME BUT I‚ÄôM A BIRD‚Äù), whereas defining success for a Web browser involves Cascading Style Sheets, a technology which intrinsically dooms any project to epic failure. For the uninitiated, Cascading Style Sheets are a cryptic language developed by the Freemasons to obscure the visual nature of reality and encourage people to depict things using ASCII art. Ostensibly, CSS files allow you to separate the definition of your content from the definition of how that content looks‚Äîusing CSS, you can specify the layout for your HTML tags, as well as the fonts and the color schemes used by those tags. Sadly, the relationship between CSS and HTML is the same relationship that links the instructions for building your IKEA bed, and the unassembled, spiteful wooden planks that purportedly contain latent bed structures. CSS is not so much a description of what your final page will look like, but rather a loose, high-level overview of what could happen to your page, depending on the weather, the stock market, and how long it‚Äôs been since you last spoke to your mother. Like a na√Øve  Dungeon Master untouched by the sorrow of adulthood, you create imaginative CSS classes for your <div> tags and your <span> tags, assigning them strengths and weaknesses, and defining the roles that they will play in the larger, uplifting narrative of your HTML. Everything is assembled in its proper place; you load your page in a browser and prepare yourself for a  glorious victory. However, you quickly discover that your elf tag is over-weight. THE ELF CAN NEVER BE OVERWEIGHT. Even worse, your barbarian tag does not have an oversized hammer or axe. Without an oversized hammer or axe, YOUR BARBARIAN IS JUST AN ILLITER ATE STEROID USER. And then you look at your wizard tag, and you see that he‚Äôs not an old white man with a flowing beard, but a young black man from Brooklyn. FOR COMPLEX REASONS THAT ARE ROOTED IN EUROPEAN COLONIAL NARR ATIVES, YOUR  WIZARD MUST BE AN OLD WHITE MAN WITH A FLOWING BEARD,NOT A BLACK MAN WITH HIPSTER SHOES AND A FANTASTIC VINYL COLLECTION. Such are the disasters that CSS will wroughth upon thee. Or wrought *at* thee. To be honest, I don‚Äôt know how to conjugate or spell ‚Äúwrought,‚Äù but my point is undoubtedly understood. See Figure 1 for a concrete example of CSS‚Äôs wroughtiness. Or CSS‚Äô (no trailing ‚Äús‚Äù) wroughtiness. MY NON-CASCADING STYLE MANUALS FIGHT FOR MY SOUL.When you‚Äôre a Web developer, CSS is just one of your  worries. The aggregate stack of Web technologies is so fragile that developers just accept a world in which various parts of a Web page will fail at random times. Apparently this is okay because e-commerce isn‚Äôt a serious thing, and if you really wanted a secure banking experience, you‚Äôd visit the bank in person like someone from the 1800s instead of accessing a banking Web site that is constantly (but silently) vomiting execution errors to the console log (a console log which the browser does not show by default, because if you knew about it, and you read its tales of woe, you‚Äôd abandon computer science and become a maker of fine wooden shoes). In Figure 2, I provide an unaltered example of such a console log; the log was generated by a real Web page from a popular site.
An interpretation of the remaining errors is left as an exercise to the reader. Note that understanding the eighth error requires a Ouija board, the eye of a newt, and the whispering of a secret to a long-lost friend.At this point, it should be intuitively obvious that different browsers may or may not produce the same error log for the same page. In general, if a Web page has more than three bits of entropy, different browsers will generate extravagantly unique mappings between the Web developer‚Äôs intentions and the schizophrenic beast palette that browsers use to paint the world. Thus, picking the ‚Äúbest browser‚Äù is like playing one of those horrid trust-building exercises where you decide then your coworkers berate you for making different tradeoffs than they made, even though there is no partial ordering that relates scuba diving accidents in which you lose your ears and eyes, and industrial accidents in which you lose your nose and tongue. All options are bad options; it‚Äôs a world of lateral moves. Indeed, trying to pick the best browser is like trying to decide which of your worthless children should inherit the  family business. Little Oliver refuses to accept society‚Äôs notion of what an event handling loop should do, so whenever the user presses a key on the keyboard, Oliver does not fire one keyPress event, but instead three keyDown events, a keyUp event, and the deleted saxophone solo from Mozart‚Äôs eighth symphony. Dearest Fiona, an unrepentant workaholic, designed her browser so that when you ‚Äúclose‚Äù it, the GUI goes away, but the underlying process lingers in the background, silent and angry, slowly consuming entries in kernel tables and making it impossible to restart the browser without receiving the error message ‚ÄúSomewhere in this world, another copy of the browser is running; find Carmen Sandiego and she will reveal the truth.‚Äù Beloved Christopher, in an attempt to make his browser fast and lightweight, decided to replace his Flash plugin with code that prints ‚ÄúShockwave has crashed‚Äù and then immediately dereferences a NULL pointer; this ensures that most attempts to watch a video will end with you wishing for the simpler audiovisual pleasures of a woodcut or cave painting. And poor IE6, voted ‚ÄúLeast Likely to Succeed Because IE6 Is Not a Proper Christian Name,‚Äù manages to stumble through the world while surviving more assassination attempts than Fidel Castro.Each browser is reckless and fanciful in its own way, but all browsers share a love of epic paging to disk. Not an infrequent showering of petite I/Os that are aligned on the allocation boundaries of the file system‚ÄîI mean adversarial thunder-snows of reads and writes, a primordial deluge that makes you gather your kinfolk and think about which things you need two of, and what the consequences would be if you didn‚Äôt bring fire ants, because fire ants ruin summers. Browsers don‚Äôt require a specific reason to thrash the disk; instead, paging is a way of life for browsers, a leisure activity that is fulfilling in and of itself. If you‚Äôre not a computer scientist or a tinkerer, you just accept the fact that going to CNN.com will cause the green blinky light with the cylinder icon to stay green and not blinky. However, if you know how computers work, the incessant paging drives you mad. It turns you into Torquemada, a wretched figure consumed by the fear that your ideological system is an elaborate lie designed to hide the excessive disk seeks of shadowy overlords.

Of course, the most popular advice for solving any browser problem is to clear your browser cache. It is definitely true that emptying the cache will sometimes help, in the same sense that if you‚Äôre poor, kicking a tree will sometimes lead to a  hilarious series of events that conclude with you finding a big bag of money on the ground with a note that says, ‚ÄúSpend it all! XOXO, Life.‚Äù Unfortunately, kicking a tree does not typically lead to riches, so your faith-based act of tree assault really just makes you a savage, tree-kicking monster who will be vilified by children and emotionally sensitive adults. Similarly, your arbitrary clearing of the browser cache, however well-intentioned, is just a topical anesthetic to brief ly dull the pain of existence. Clearing the cache to fix a Web browser is like when your dad was driving you to kindergarten, and the car started to smoke, and he tried to fix the car by banging on the hood three times and then asking you if you could still smell the carbon monoxide, and you said, ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs better,‚Äù because you didn‚Äôt want to expose your dad as a fraud, and then both of you rode to school in silence as you struggled to remain conscious.So, yes, it would be great if fixing your browser involved actions that were not semantically equivalent to voodoo. But, on the bright side, things could always be worse. For example, it would definitely be horrible if your browser‚Äôs scripting language combined the prototype-based inheritance of Self, a quasi-functional aspect borrowed from LISP, a structured syntax adapted from C, and an aggressively asynchronous I/O model that requires elaborate callback chains that span multiple generations of hard-working Americans. OH NO I‚ÄôVE JUST DESCRIBED JAVASCRIPT. What an unpleasant turn of events! People were begging for a combination of Self, LISP, and C in the same way that the denizens of Middle Earth were begging Saruman to breed Orcs and men to make Uruk-hai. Orcs and men were doing a fine job of struggling in their separate communities‚Äîcreating a new race with the drawbacks of both is not a good way to win popularity contests. But despite its faults, JavaScript has become widespread. Discovering why this happened is similar to understanding the causes for World War I‚Äîeveryone agrees on the top five reasons, but everyone ranks those causes differently. The basic story is that, in the ‚Äô90s, when JavaScript and Java were competing for client-side supremacy, Java applets were horrendously slow and lacked a story for interacting with HTML; in contrast, JavaScript was only semi-horrendously slow, and it had a bad (but extant) story for interacting with HTML. So, Java lost, despite facts like this.
I could go on and on about the reasons why JavaScript is a cancer upon the world. I know that there are people who like JavaScript, and I hope that these people find the mental health services that they so desperately need. I don‚Äôt know all of the answers in life, but I do know all of the things which aren‚Äôt the answers, and JavaScript falls into the same category as Scientology, homeopathic medicine, and making dogs wear tiny sweaters due to a misplaced belief that this is what dogs would do if they had access to looms and opposable thumbs.In summary, Web browsers are like quantum physics: they offer probabilistic guarantees at best, and anyone who claims to fully understand them is a liar. At this stage in human development, there are big problems to solve: climate change, heart disease, the poor financial situation of Nigerian princes who want to contact you directly. With all of these problems unsolved, Web browsing is a terrible way to spend our time; the last thing that we should do is run unstable hobbyist operating systems that download strange JavaScript files from people we don‚Äôt know. Instead, we should exchange information using fixed-length ASCII messages written in a statically verifiable subset of Latin, with images represented as mathematical combinations of line segments, arcs, and other timeless shapes described by dead philosophers who believed that minotaurs were real but incapable of escaping mazes. That is the kind of clear thinking that will help us defeat the space Egyptians that emerge from the StarGates. Or whatever. I‚Äôm an American and I don‚Äôt really understand history, but I strongly believe that Greeks spoke Latin to defeat intergalactic Egyptians. #TeachTheControversy! Anyways, my point is that browsers are too complex to be trusted. Unfortunately, youth is always wasted on the young, and the current generation of software developers is convinced that browsers need more features, not fewer. So, we are encouraged to celebrate the fact that browsers turn our computers into little Star Wars cantinas where everyone is welcome and you can drink a blue drink if you want to drink a blue drink and if something bad happens, then maybe  a Jedi will save you, and if not, HEY IT‚ÄôS A STAR WARS CANTINA YESSSSS. Space cantinas are fun, but they‚Äôre just a fantasy; they‚Äôre just a series of outlandish details stitched together to amuse and entertain. You have to open your eyes and see that in the real, non-hyperbolic world that you actually inhabit, your browser will frequently stop playing a video and then display flashing epilepsy pixels while making the sound that TVs make in Japanese horror movies before a pasty sala - mander child steps out of the screen and voids your warranty. That‚Äôs a thing which could actually happen, and we should wash it all away.
According to my dad, flying in airplanes used to be fun. You could smoke on the plane, and smoking was actually good for you. Everybody was attractive, and there were no fees for anything, and there was so much legroom that you could orient your body parts in arbitrary and profane directions without bothering anyone, and you could eat caviar and manatee steak as you were showered with piles of money that were personally distributed by JFK and The Beach Boys. Times were good, assuming that you were a white man in the advertising business, WHICH MY FATHER WAS NOT SO PERHAPS I SHOULD ASK HIM SOME FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS BUT I DIGRESS. The point is that f lying in airplanes used to be fun, but now it resembles a dystopian bin-packing problem in which humans, carry-on luggage, and five dollar peanut bags compete for real estate while crying children materialize from the ether and make obscure demands in unintelligible, Wookie-like languages while you fantasize about who you won‚Äôt be helping when the oxygen masks descend.I think that it used to be fun to be a hardware architect. Anything that you invented would be amazing, and the laws of physics were actively trying to help you succeed. Your friend would say, ‚ÄúI wish that we could predict branches more accurately,‚Äù and you‚Äôd think, ‚Äúmaybe we can leverage three bits of state per branch to implement a simple saturating counter,‚Äù and you‚Äôd laugh and declare that such a stupid scheme would never work, but then you‚Äôd test it and it would be 94% accurate, and the branches would wake up the next morning and read their newspapers and the headlines would say OUR WORLD HAS BEEN SET ON FIRE. You‚Äôd give your buddy a high-five and go celebrate at the bar, and then you‚Äôd think, ‚ÄúI wonder if we can make branch predictors even more accurate,‚Äù and the next day you‚Äôd start XOR‚Äôing the branch‚Äôs PC address with a shift register containing the branch‚Äôs recent branching history, because in those days, you could XOR anything with anything and get something useful, and you test the new branch predictor, and now you‚Äôre up to 96% accuracy, and the branches call you on the phone and say OK, WE GET IT, YOU DO NOT LIKE BRANCHES, but the phone call goes to your voicemail because you‚Äôre too busy driving the speed boats and wearing the monocles that you purchased after your  promotion at work. You go to work hung-over, and you realize that, during a drunken conference call, you told your boss that your processor has 32 registers when it only has 8, but then you realize THAT YOU CAN TOTALLY LIE ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PHYSICAL REGISTERS, and you invent a crazy hardware mapping scheme from virtual registers to physical ones, and at this point, you start seducing the spouses of the compiler team, because it‚Äôs pretty clear that compilers are a thing of the past, and the next generation of processors will run English-level pseudocode directly. Of course, pride precedes the fall, and at some point, you realize that to implement aggressive out-of-order execution, you need to fit more transistors into the same die size, but then a material science guy pops out of a birthday cake and says YEAH WE CAN DO THAT, and by now, you‚Äôre touring with Aerosmith and throwing Matisse paintings from hotel room windows, because when you order two Matisse paintings from room service and you get three, that equation is going to be balanced. It all goes so well, and the party keeps getting better. When you retire in 2003, your face is wrinkled from all of the smiles, and even though you‚Äôve been sued by several pedestrians who suddenly acquired rare paintings as hats, you go out on top, the master of your domain. You look at your son John, who just joined Intel, and you rest well at night, knowing that he can look forward to a pliant universe and an easy life.Unfortunately for John, the branches made a pact with Satan and quantum mechanics during a midnight screening of ‚ÄúWeekend at Bernie‚Äôs II.‚Äù In exchange for their last remaining bits of entropy, the branches cast evil spells on future generations of processors. Those evil spells had names like ‚Äúscaling-induced voltage leaks‚Äù and ‚Äúincreasing levels of waste heat‚Äù and ‚ÄúPauly Shore, who is only loosely connected to computer architecture, but who will continue to produce a new movie every three years until he sublimates into an empty bag of Cheetos and a pair of those running shoes that have individual toes and that make you look like you received a foot transplant from a Hobbit, Sasquatch, or an infertile Hobbit/Sasquatch hybrid.‚Äù Once again, I digress. The point is that the branches, those vanquished foes from long ago, would have the last laugh.When John went to work in 2003, he had an indomitable spirit and a love for danger, reminding people of a less attractive Ernest Hemingway or an equivalently attractive Winston Churchill. As a child in 1977, John had met Gordon Moore; Gordon had pulled a quarter from behind John‚Äôs ear and then proclaimed that he would pull twice as many quarters from John‚Äôs ear every 18 months. Moore, of course, was an incorrigible liar and tormentor of youths, and he never pulled another quarter from John‚Äôs ear again, having immediately f led the scene while yelling that Hong Kong will always be a British territory, and nobody will ever pay $8 for a Mocha Frappuccino, and a variety of other things that seemed like universal laws to people at the time, but were actually just arbitrary nouns and adjectives that Moore had scrawled on a napkin earlier that morning. Regardless, John was changed forever, and when he grew up and became a hardware architect, he poured all of his genius into making transistors smaller and more efficient. For a while, John‚Äôs efforts were rewarded with ever-faster CPUs, but at a certain point, the transistors became so small that they started to misbehave. They randomly switched states; they leaked voltage; they fell prey to the seductive whims of cosmic rays that, unlike the cosmic rays in comic books, did not turn you into a superhero, but instead made your transistors unreliable and shiftless, like a surly teenager who is told to clean his room and who will occasionally just spray his bed with Lysol and declare victory.As the transistors became increasingly unpredictable, the foundations of John‚Äôs world began to crumble. So, John did what any reasonable person would do: he cloaked himself in a wall of denial and acted like nothing had happened. ‚ÄúMaking processors faster is increasingly difficult,‚Äù John thought, ‚Äúbut maybe people won‚Äôt notice if I give them more processors.‚Äù This, of course, was a variant of the notorious Zubotov Gambit, named after the Soviet-era car manufacturer who abandoned its attempts to make its cars not explode, and instead offered customers two Zubotovs for the price of one, under the assumption that having two occasionally combustible items will distract you from the fact that both items are still occasionally combustible. John quietly began to harness a similar strategy, telling his marketing team to deemphasize their processors‚Äô speed, and emphasize their level of parallelism. At first, John‚Äôs processors f lew off the shelves. Indeed, who wouldn‚Äôt want an octavo-core machine with 73 virtual hyper-threads per physical processor? Alan Greenspan‚Äôs loose core policy and weak parallelism regulation were declared a resounding success, and John sipped on champagne as he watched the money roll in. However, a bubble is born so that a bubble can pop, and this one was no different. John‚Äôs massive parallelism strategy assumed that lay people use their computers to simulate hurricanes, decode monkey genomes, and otherwise multiply vast, unfathomably dimensioned matrices in a desperate attempt to unlock eigenvectors whose desolate grandeur could only be imagined by Edgar Allen Poe. Of course, lay people do not actually spend their time trying to invert massive hash values while rendering nine copies of the Avatar planet in 1080p. Lay people use their computers for precisely ten things, none of which involve massive computational parallelism, and seven of which involve procuring a vast menagerie of pornographic data and then curating that data using a variety of fairly obvious management techniques, like the creation of a folder called ‚ÄúWork Stuff,‚Äù which contains an inner folder called ‚ÄúMore Work Stuff,‚Äù where ‚ÄúMore Work Stuff ‚Äù contains a series of ostensible documentaries that describe the economic interactions between people who don‚Äôt have enough money to pay for pizza and people who aren‚Äôt too bothered by that fact. Thus, when John said ‚Äúimagine a world in which you‚Äôre constantly executing millions of parallel tasks,‚Äù it was equivalent to saying ‚Äúimagine a world that you do not and will never live in.‚Äù Indeed, a world in which you‚Äôre constantly simulating nuclear explosions while rendering massive 3D environments is a world that‚Äôs been taken over by members of a high school A.V. club. The members of a high school A.V. club lack the chops to establish a global dictatorship, if only because doing such a thing would require them to reduce their visits to Renaissance festivals, and those turkey legs need help to be consumed in the style of a 15th century Italian aristocrat.John was terrified by the collapse of the parallelism bubble, and he quickly discarded his plans for a 743-core processor that was dubbed The Hydra of Destiny and whose abstract Platonic ideal was brief ly the third-best chess player in Gary, Indiana. Clutching a bottle of whiskey in one hand and a shot-gun in the other, John scoured the research literature for ideas that might save his dreams of infinite scaling. He discovered several papers that described software-assisted hardware recovery. The basic idea was simple: if hardware suffers more transient failures as it gets smaller, why not allow software to detect erroneous computations and re-execute them? This idea seemed promising until John realized THAT IT WAS THE WORST IDEA EVER. Modern software barely works when the hardware is correct, so relying on software to correct hardware errors is like asking Godzilla to prevent Mega-Godzilla from terrorizing Japan. THIS DOES NOT LEAD TO RISING PROPERTY VALUES IN TOKYO. It‚Äôs better to stop scaling your transistors and avoid playing with monsters in the first place, instead of devising an elaborate series of monster checks-and-balances and then hoping that the monsters don‚Äôt do what monsters are always going to do because if they didn‚Äôt do those things, they‚Äôd be called dandelions or puppy hugs.At this point, John was living under a bridge and wearing a bird‚Äôs nest as a hat. Despite his tragic sartorial collaborations with the avian world, John still believed that somehow, some way, he could continue to make his transistors smaller. Perhaps the processor could run multiple copies of each program, comparing the results to detect errors? Perhaps a new video codec could tolerate persistently hateful levels of hardware error? All of these techniques could be implemented. However, John slowly realized that these solutions were just things that he could do, and inventing ‚Äúa thing that you could do‚Äù is a low bar for human achievement. If I were walking past your house and I saw that it was on fire, I could try to put out the fire by finding a dingo and then teaching it how to speak Spanish. That‚Äôs certainly a thing that I could do. However, when you arrived at your erstwhile house and found a pile of heirloom ashes, me, and a dingo with a chewed-up Rosetta Stone box, you would be less than pleased, despite my protestations that negative scientific results are useful and I had just proven that Spanish-illiterate dingoes cannot extinguish fires using mind power.It was at this moment, when John had hit the bottom, that he discovered religion.John began to attend The Church of the Impending Power Catastrophe. He sat in the pew and he heard the cautionary tales, and he was afraid. John learned about the new hyper-threaded processor from AMD that ran so hot that it burned a hole to the center of the earth, yelled ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to rejoin my people!‚Äù, discovered that magma people are extremely bigoted against processor people, and then created the Processor Liberation Front to wage a decades-long, hilariously futile War to Burn the Intrinsically OK-With-Being-Burnt Magma People. John learned about the rumored Intel Septium chip, a chip whose prototype had been turned on exactly once, and which had leaked so much voltage that it had transformed into a young Linda Blair and demanded an exorcism before it embarked on a series of poor career moves that culminated in an inevitable spokesperson role for PETA. The future was bleak, and John knew that he had to fight it. So, John repented his addiction to scaling, and he rededicated his life to reducing the power consumption of CPUs. It was a hard path, and a lonely path, but John could find no other way. Formerly the life of the party, John now resembled the scraggly, one-eyed wizard in a fantasy novel who constantly warns the protagonist about the variety of things that can lead to monocular bescraggle-ment. At team meetings, whenever someone proposed a new hardware feature, John would yell ‚ÄúTHE MAGMA PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR OUR MISTAKES.‚Äù He would then throw a coffee cup at the speaker and say that adding new hardware features would require each processor to be connected to a dedicated coal plant in West Virginia. John‚Äôs coworkers eventually understood his wisdom, and their need to wear coffee-resistant indoor ponchos lessened with time. Every evening, after John left work, he went to the bus stop and distributed power literature to strangers, telling them to abandon transistor scaling and save their souls. Standing next to John, another man wore a sandwich board that said that the Federal Reserve was using f luorinated water to hide the fact that we never landed on the moon. The sandwich board required no transistors at all. It made John smile.When John comes home for the holidays, you‚Äôre glad that he‚Äôs back, but you miss the old twinkle in his eye. Your thoughts wander to your own glory days thirty years ago, when Aero-smith mistook young John for a large Xanax tablet and tried to trade him for a surface-to-air missile that could be used against anti-classic rock regimes. Oh, how you laughed! The subsequent visit by Child Protection Services was less amusing, but that was the way that hardware architects lived: working hard, partying hard, and occasionally waking up in Tijuana to discover that your left kidney is missing and your toddler has been shipped to a Columbian arms smuggler. It was crazy, but you wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. Your generation had lived so many dreams, and slain so many foes. Today, if a person uses a desktop or laptop, she is justifiably angry if she discovers that her machine is doing a non-trivial amount of work. If her hard disk is active for more than a second per hour, or if her CPU utilization goes above 4%, she either has a computer virus, or she made the disastrous decision to run a Java program. Either way, it‚Äôs not your fault: you brought the fire down from Olympus, and the mortals do with it what they will. But now, all the easy giants were dead, and John was left to fight the ghosts that Schr√∂dinger had left behind. ‚ÄúJohn,‚Äù you say as you pour some eggnog, ‚Äúdid I ever tell you how I implemented an out-of-order pipeline with David Hasselhoff and Hulk Hogan‚Äôs moustache colorist?‚Äù You are suddenly aware that you left your poncho in the other room.
Sometimes, when I check my work email, I‚Äôll find a message that says ‚ÄúTalk Announcement: Vertex-based Elliptic Cryptography on N-way Bojangle Spaces.‚Äù I‚Äôll look at the abstract for the talk, and it will say something like this: ‚ÄúIt is well-known that five-way secret sharing has been illegal since the Protestant Reformation [Luther1517]. However, using recent advances in polynomial-time Bojangle projections, we demonstrate how a set of peers who are frenemies can exchange up to five snide remarks that are robust to Bojangle-chosen plaintext attacks.‚Äù I feel like these emails start in the middle of a tragic but unlikely-to-be-interesting opera. Why, exactly, have we been thrust into an elliptical world? Who, exactly, is Bojangle, and why do we care about the text that he chooses? If we care about him because he has abducted our families, can I at least exchange messages with those family members, and if so, do those messages have to be snide? Researchers who work on problems like these remind me of my friends who train for triathlons. When I encounter such a friend, I say, ‚ÄúIn the normal universe, when are you ever going to be chased by someone into a lake, and then onto a bike, and then onto a road where you can‚Äôt drive a car, but you can run in a wetsuit? Will that ever happen? If so, instead of training for such an event, perhaps a better activity is to discover why a madman is forcing people to swim, then bike, and then run.‚Äù My friend will generally reply, ‚ÄúTriathlons are good exercise,‚Äù and I‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true, assuming that you‚Äôve made a series of bad life decisions that result in you being hunted by an amphibious Ronald McDonald.‚Äù My friend will say, ‚ÄúHow do you know that it‚Äôs Ronald McDonald who‚Äôs chasing me?‚Äù, and I‚Äôll say ‚ÄúOPEN YOUR EYES WHO ELSE COULD IT BE?‚Äù, and then my friend will stop talking to me about triathlons, and I will be okay with this outcome.In general, I think that security researchers have a problem with public relations. Security people are like smarmy teenagers who listen to goth music: they are full of morbid and detailed monologues about the pervasive catastrophes that surround us, but they are much less interested in the practical topic of what people should do before we‚Äôre inevitably killed by ravens or a shortage of black mascara. It‚Äôs like, websites are amazing BUT DON‚ÄôT CLICK ON THAT LINK, and your phone can run all of these amazing apps BUT MANY OF YOUR APPS ARE EVIL, and if you order a Russian bride on Craigslist YOU MAY GET A CONFUSED FILIPINO MAN WHO DOES NOT LIKE BEING SHIPPED IN A BOX. It‚Äôs not clear what else there is to do with computers besides click on things, run applications, and fill spiritual voids using destitute mail-ordered foreigners. If the security people are correct, then the only provably safe activity is to stare at a horseshoe whose integrity has been verified by a quorum of Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman. Somehow, I am not excited to live in the manner of a Pilgrim who magically has access to 3-choose-2 {Rivest, Shamir, Adleman}, mainly because, if I were a bored Pilgrim who possessed a kidnapping time machine, I would kidnap Samuel L. Jackson or Robocop, not mathematical wizards from the future who would taunt me with their knowledge of prime numbers and how ‚ÄúBreaking Bad‚Äù ends.The only thing that I‚Äôve ever wanted for Christmas is an automated way to generate strong yet memorable passwords. Unfortunately, large swaths of the security community are fixated on avant garde horrors such as the fact that, during solar eclipses, pacemakers can be remotely controlled with a garage door opener and a Pringles can. It‚Äôs definitely unfortunate that Pringles cans are the gateway to an obscure set of Sith-like powers that can be used against the 0.002% of the population that has both a pacemaker and bitter enemies in the electronics hobbyist community. However, if someone is motivated enough to kill you by focusing electromagnetic energy through a Pringles can, you probably did something to deserve that. I am not saying that I want you dead, but I am saying that you may have to die so that researchers who study per-photon HMACs for pacemaker transmitters can instead work on making it easier for people to generate good passwords. ‚ÄúBut James,‚Äù you protest, ‚Äúthere are many best practices for choosing passwords!‚Äù Yes, I am aware of the ‚Äúuse a vivid image‚Äù technique, and if I lived in a sensory deprivation tank and I had never used the Internet, I could easily remember a password phrase like ‚ÄúGigantic Martian Insect Party.‚Äù Unfortunately, I have used the Internet, and this means that I have seen, heard, and occasionally paid money for every thing that could ever be imagined. I have seen a video called ‚ÄúGigantic Martian Insect Party,‚Äù and I have seen another video called ‚ÄúGigantic Martian Insect Party 2: Don‚Äôt Tell Mom,‚Äù and I hated both videos, but this did not stop me from directing the sequel ‚ÄúGigantic Martian Insect Party Into Darkness.‚Äù Thus, it is extremely difficult for me to generate a memorable image that can distinguish itself from the seething ocean of absurdities that I store as a result of consuming 31 hours of media in each 24-hour period.
So, coming up with a memorable image is difficult, and to make things worse, the security people tell me that I need differentpasswords for different web sites. Now I‚Äôm expected to remember both ‚ÄúGigantic Martian Insect Party‚Äù and ‚ÄúStructurally Unsound Yeti Tote-bag,‚Äù and I have to somehow recall which phrase is associated with my banking web site, and which one is associated with some other site that doesn‚Äôt involve extraterrestrial insects or Yeti accoutrements. This is uncivilized and I demand more from life. Thus, when security researchers tell me that they‚Äôre not working on passwords, it‚Äôs like physicists from World War II telling me that they‚Äôre not working on radar or nuclear bombs, but instead they‚Äôre unravelling the mystery of how bumblebees f ly. It‚Äôs like, you are so close, and yet so far. You almost get it, but that‚Äôs worse than not getting it at all.My point is that security people need to get their priorities straight. The ‚Äúthreat model‚Äù section of a security paper resembles the script for a telenovela that was written by a paranoid schizophrenic: there are elaborate narratives and grand conspiracy theories, and there are heroes and villains with fantastic (yet oddly constrained) powers that necessitate a grinding battle of emotional and technical attrition. In the real world, threat models are much simpler (see Figure 1). Basically, you‚Äôre either dealing with Mossad or not-Mossad. If your adversary is not-Mossad, then you‚Äôll probably be fine if you pick a good password and don‚Äôt respond to emails from ChEaPestPAiNPi11s@virus-basket.biz.ru. If your adversary is the Mossad, YOU‚ÄôRE GONNA DIE AND THERE‚ÄôS NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. The Mossad is not intimidated by the fact that you employ https://. If the Mossad wants your data, they‚Äôre going to use a drone to replace your cellphone with a piece of uranium that‚Äôs shaped like a cellphone, and when you die of tumors filled with tumors, they‚Äôre going to hold a press conference and say ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt us‚Äù as they wear t-shirts that say ‚ÄúIT WAS DEFINITELY US,‚Äù and then they‚Äôre going to buy all of your stuff at your estate sale so that they can directly look at the photos of your vacation instead of reading your insipid emails about them. In summary, https:// and two dollars will get you a bus ticket to nowhere. Also, SANTA CLAUS ISN‚ÄôT REAL. When it rains, it pours.
The Mossad/not-Mossad duality is just one of the truths that security researchers try to hide from you. The security community employs a variety of misdirections and soothing words to obscure the ultimate nature of reality; in this regard, they resemble used car salesmen and Girl Scouts (whose ‚Äúcookie sales‚Äù are merely shell companies for the Yakuza). When you read a security paper, there‚Äôs often a sentence near the beginning that says ‚Äúassume that a public key cryptosystem exists.‚Äù The authors intend for you to read this sentence in a breezy, carefree way, as if establishing a scalable key infrastructure is a weekend project, akin to organizing a walk-in closet or taming a chinchilla. Given such a public key infrastructure, the authors propose all kinds of entertaining, Ferris Bueller-like things that you can do, like taking hashes of keys, and arranging keys into fanciful tree-like structures, and determining which users are bad so that their keys can be destroyed, or revoked, or mixed with concrete and rendered inert. This Caligula-style key party sounds like great fun, but constructing a public key infrastructure is incredibly difficult in practice. When someone says ‚Äúassume that a public key cryptosystem exists,‚Äù this is roughly equivalent to saying ‚Äúassume that you could clone dinosaurs, and that you could fill a park with these dinosaurs, and that you could get a ticket to this ‚ÄòJurassic Park,‚Äô and that you could stroll throughout this park without getting eaten, clawed, or otherwise quantum entangled with a macroscopic dinosaur particle.‚Äù  With public key cryptography, there‚Äôs a horrible, fundamental challenge of finding somebody, anybody, to establish and maintain the infrastructure. For example, you could enlist a well-known technology company to do it, but this would offend the refined aesthetics of the vaguely Marxist but comfortably bourgeoisie hacker community who wants everything to be decentralized and who non-ironically believes that Tor is used for things besides drug deals and kidnapping plots. Alternatively, the public key infrastructure could use a decentralized ‚Äúweb-of-trust‚Äù model; in this architecture, individuals make their own keys and certify the keys of trusted associates, creating chains of attestation. ‚ÄúChains of Attestation‚Äù is a great name for a heavy metal band, but it is less practical in the real, non-Ozzy-Ozbourne-based world, since I don‚Äôt just need a chain of attestation between me and some unknown, filthy stranger‚ÄîI also need a chain of attestation for each link in that chain. This recursive attestation eventually leads to fractals and H.P. Lovecraft-style madness. Web-of-trust cryptosystems also result in the generation of emails with incredibly short bodies (e.g., ‚ÄúR U gonna be at the gym 2nite?!?!?!?‚Äù) and multi-kilobyte PGP key attachments, leading to a packet framing overhead of 98.5%. PGP enthusiasts are like your friend with the ethno-literature degree whose multi-paragraph email signature has fourteen Buddhist quotes about wisdom and mankind‚Äôs relationship to trees. It‚Äôs like, I GET IT. You care deeply about the things that you care about. Please leave me alone so that I can ponder the inevitability of death.Even worse than the PGP acolytes are the folks who claim that we can use online social networks to bootstrap a key infrastructure. Sadly, the people in an online social network are the same confused, ill-equipped blunderhats who inhabit the physical world. Thus, social network people are the same people who install desktop search toolbars, and who try to click on the monkey to win an iPad, and who are willing to at least entertain the notion that buying a fortune-telling app for any more money than ‚Äúno money‚Äù is a good idea. These are not the best people in the history of people, yet somehow, I am supposed to stitch these clowns into a rich cryptographic tapestry that supports key revocation and verifiable audit trails. One time, I was on a plane, and a man asked me why his laptop wasn‚Äôt working, and I tried to hit the power button, and I noticed that the power button was sticky, and I said, hey, why is the power button sticky, and he said, oh, IT‚ÄôS BECAUSE I SPILLED AN ENTIRE SODA ONTO IT BUT THAT‚ÄôS NOT A PROBLEM RIGHT? I don‚Äôt think that this dude is ready to orchestrate cryptographic operations on 2048-bit integers.Another myth spread by security researchers is that the planet Earth contains more than six programmers who can correctly use security labels and information f low control (IFC). This belief requires one to assume that, even though the most popular variable names are ‚Äúthing‚Äù and ‚Äúthing2,‚Äù programmers will magically become disciplined software architects when confronted with a Dungeons-and-Dragons-style type system that requires variables to be annotated with rich biographical data and a list of vulnerabilities to output sinks. People feel genuine anxiety when asked if they want large fries for just 50 cents more, so I doubt that unfathomable lattice-based calculus is going to be a hit with the youths. I mean, yes, I understand how one can use labels to write a secure version of HelloWorld( ), but once my program gets bigger than ten functions, my desire to think about combinatorial label f lows will decrease and be replaced by an urgent desire to DECLASSIFY( ) so that I can go home and stop worrying about morally troubling phrases like ‚Äútaint explosion‚Äù that are typically associated with the diaper industry and FEMA. I realize that, in an ideal world, I would recycle my trash, and contribute 10% of my income to charity, and willingly accept the cognitive overhead of fine-grained security labels. However, pragmatists understand that I will spend the bulk of my disposable income on comic books, and instead of recycling, I will throw all of my trash into New Jersey, where it will self-organize into elaborate ‚ÄúMatrix‚Äù-like simulations of the seagull world, simulations that consist solely of choking-hazard-sized particles and seagull-shaped objects that are not seagulls and that will not respond to seagull mating rituals by producing new seagull children. This is definitely a problem, but problem identification is what makes science fun, and now we know that we need to send SWAT teams into New Jersey to disarm a trash-based cellular automaton that threatens the seagull way of life. Similarly, we know that IFC research should not focus on what would happen if I somehow used seventeen types of labels to describe three types of variables. Instead, IFC research should focus on what will happen when I definitely give all my variables The God Label so that my program compiles and I can return to my loved ones. Incidentally, I think that ‚ÄúThe God Label‚Äù was an important plot device in the sixth ‚ÄúDune‚Äù novel, but I stopped reading that series after the fifth book and my seven-hundredth time reading a speech that started ‚ÄúWHOEVER CONTROLS THE SPICE CONTROLS THE (SOME THING WHICH IS NOT THE SPICE).‚Äù Also note that if a police officer ever tries to give you a speeding ticket, do not tell him that you are the Kwisatz Haderach and You Can See Where No Bene Gesserit Can See and you cannot see a speeding ticket. This defense will not hold up in court, and the only ‚Äúspice‚Äù that you will find in prison is made of mouthwash and fermented oranges.
The worst part about growing up is that the world becomes more constrained. As a child, it seems completely reasonable to build a spaceship out of bed sheets, firecrackers, and lawn furniture; as you get older, you realize that the S.S. Improbable will not take you to space, but instead a lonely killing field of fire, Child Protective Services, and awkward local news interviews, not necessarily in that order, but with everything showing up eventually. Security research is the continual process of discovering that your spaceship is a deathtrap. However, as John F. Kennedy once said, ‚ÄúSCREW IT WE‚ÄôRE GOING TO THE MOON.‚Äù I cannot live my life in fear because someone named PhreakusMaximus at DefConHat 2014 showed that you can induce peanut allergies at a distance using an SMS message and a lock of your victim‚Äôs hair. If that‚Äôs how it is, I accept it and move on. Thinking about security is like thinking about where to ride your motorcycle: the safe places are no fun, and the fun places are not safe. I shall ride wherever my spirit takes me, and I shall find my Gigantic Martian Insect Party, and I will, uh, probably be rent asunder by huge cryptozoological mandibles, but I will die like Thomas Jefferson: free, defiant, and without a security label.
Hello, my name is James Mickens. And I'm glad to be opening the Velocity Conference. Let it be known that I'm an American. Okay, and I offer you my protection. This conference is going to be a success precisely because an American is here. Now. I know that many of you think that Americans just want to blow stuff up and tell people what to do, but I can assure you Americans are smart. Okay, for example, I learned how to speak German in three days. So when I showed up at the Boston airport, I was already fluent.
Yeah, as you can tell I'm a level 7 German speaker and there are only six levels. So please stop by my session tomorrow using hand gestures instead of conjugating verbs properly. It's going to be fun. But that's not what my keynote is about. My keynote is actually about some bad ideas and Tech that refused to die these ideas cling to life despite the fact that we all know better. So let's start with an easy one first in the modern-day who is still a blockchain person. These people were supposed to be wiped out by the asteroid strike and yet they walk amongst us. I want to understand them much like a sketch him the Bulb Store of the Pokemon cartoons. I take great pleasure in cataloging the different types of blockchain enthusiasts. For example, look behind that shrub. It's someone trying to sell you an Enterprise wage.
Hey little buddy. What's the technical difference between an Enterprise blockchain and a regular distributed database? Hm? Well, huh. You mean to tell me that there is no deep technical difference in that you're just using the buzzword blockchain to exploit the ignorance of qualitative. CTOs who haven't used technology since the War of 1812. Hm are you secretly admitting that people have been encrypting and signing data for Millennia parents teaching children teaching their children RSA the formulas written on Cave walls and ancient song of wisdom providing the secrecy and integrity that you tell people can only be achieved using Enterprise blockchains. Nothing to see here says the Enterprise blockchain salesman, but wait, what's that rustling in the trash can over there? Is it a raccoon, no it's a permission list blockchain enthusiasts. This kind of person is fixated on the following question.
In a world that has no trust relationships whatsoever. How can we build the distributed transaction system, but let me tell you this if you wake up and you discover that you're living in a world that has no trust relationships whatsoever. You should be asking questions. Like how do I know that my medicine isn't poison? How do I stop my potatoes from being stolen by dingoes? Because anybody can own a dingo in a world without trust? Why is Xander the hill person pointing a crossbow at my Hut mate? Do you see what I'm saying? Like, this is what a world without trust looks like you've got bigger problems than just improving the transaction throughput of a permission-less ledger. Now, of course improving the transaction throughput is an obsession of these cryptocurrency people. But why do these people still exist, these cryptocurrency enthusiasts? They're like, cicadas and vampires. They're not dead. They're just sleeping. They've coded themselves and tokens and allow the falling valuations to push them deep into the Earth where they suck or until speculators temporarily boost the price of the tokens only to bid the prices back down because cryptocurrencies are a nightmare there like the one ring or vaping once you start you get corrupted little Timmy here purchased this foolish token two years ago and after three hard Forks to stolen wallets and five cryptocurrency bankruptcies little Timmy is living on the street. Analyzing technical indicators are spiritual life, but you might say James you're being unfair we can fix these problems with more advanced cryptocurrencies. If you're worried about volatility use stablecoin that are pegged to a fiat currency. If you're worried about inflation or deflation, you can use algorithmic monetary policy. If you're worried about fraud you can run auditing tools over the transaction Ledger. Well all this is great, but I got a question for you. Is there another thing that can be pegged to a fiat currency and manage VM monetary policy and verified use?
And the answer is yes. It's called money regular money, newsflash money exists. If you want to make money better why not try to just improve money instead of starting with the disaster and then trying to improve the disaster. It's like, imagine that I wanted to make cars better. Have you heard of my new invention donkey 4,000? It's got some pretty good features like halogen lights in airbags. However, it does have some bad features like it's a donkey. It mostly doesn't go where you want it, it kicks you in the face at arbitrary moments. You see what I'm saying? These blockchain people they're living in a donkey world, but they just refused to listen to reason so this is why I claim that blockchain of Angelism is the purest form of mansplaining that is known to science.
Do you want to guess how many times a man has been at a party and a woman has verbally assaulted him about the blockchain? 0 times. This has never happened. Okay in contrast just this morning eighteen different men have come up to me and asked me if I want to talk about smart contracts. Okay. The answer is no. No, it's a no that is repeating infinitely towards the heat death of the universe. Now, of course, at least one of these men will eventually tell me that I should look me up on Twitter but here are some facts about me. It's a poem about myself that I wrote by myself. So here's the plan.
I am not on Twitter. I do not want to be on Twitter. I know what Twitter is. That's why I don't want to be on Twitter. Okay, that's the end of the point. Okay, I don't want to be on Twitter because Twitter is a cesspool and here's how I know that Twitter is a cesspool. Okay, whenever we're somebody comes up to me and says James you gotta get on Twitter. The very next thing they say is I gotta get off Twitter man. This Twitter thing. It's killing me. I hate it. So here's a true story. So a few days ago. I got invited to a middle school to teach kids about technology. So I gave the students a high-level overview of how the internet works and then I asked them to Google some of the topics that I mentioned. So a few minutes later one of the kids left her desk and walked up to me in this kid was drawn better than the other kids but life is unfair and they should teach that in schools. So the kid asked me to come look at the search results that she found and so she found the Twitter profile actually and she asked me Why is this guy's name between parenthesis. Now as you may know the reason is that white nationalists use parentheses to identify people or things that are Jewish and so as a response back from non bigoted Twitter users began to voluntarily put their names between parenthesis as a show of solidarity with Jews and Jewish people also started to use these triple parentheses a sign of defiance. So unfortunately I had to tell the kid about this Twitter phenomena and then I close the browser Tab and I said, let's just leave this place Twitter doesn't want good people to be here wage order is like the alien Prometheus Planet. Everything here is death. Stop touching the canisters. Okay. So when people ask me why I don't have a Twitter account. I say the following thing about opening a new Twitter account today. It's like starting to smoke cigarettes when you're forty-three years old. It just demonstrates that you have no conception of what life is trying to teach us at this point in time.
History we can confidently say that Twitter should not have been invented. Okay, we didn't know that in 2006 Winter was created. So we had to try but now all the facts are in okay to be fair. I have experienced moments of temporary Joy on Twitter. I've seen that video that was tweeted about the baby puppy that's trying to Hound. It's so cute because puppies have no skills. And so their attempts to how just sound like a tiny kazoo moments like this do exist on Twitter. However, every delightful moment on Twitter is embedded in a matrix of sadness and hatred there's a Fishman trying to steal your money a skull. None is pointing a judgment stick at you your drapes situation is all messed up. Nobody told you do that with the drapes. This is why people don't feel comfortable giving drapes to you. Okay, welcome to Twitter. All right for every good thing that occurs on Twitter multiple tragedies are simultaneously brought into existence.
Okay, it's like a law of quantum physics. As soon as the Tweet of that cute puppy was uploaded it immediately decayed into a tweet about vaccines causing extra head diagnostic in a tweet of how George Soros and Beyonce are hiding the fact that the Earth is flat and the international media is controlled by Jewish reptilians and reptilian Jews because yes, there is a difference in this will all be revealed about brexit is complete and England has completely detached from the Earth to become a satellite of Odin all-father.
Do you ever feel like Twitter has a Content moderation problem? I feel like that sometimes and it's not just Twitter. It's Facebook and all the other technology companies that don't want to be responsible for the content on their platforms. This is why I find it Darkly hilarious to hear these companies talk about the challenges of content moderation these Executives get up and they say stuff like, you know one worth taking this content down. The question is where do you draw the line?
There's a lot we need to address globally. We have to prioritize our resources according to impact, We want the progress that comes from free expression, but not the tension.
Right. It's just like a very sad Play constantly. When you hear these people talk about content moderation off now to be fair content moderation does pose some difficult ethical challenges. Okay, but so does the collection of user data for targeted advertising and here's how companies have responded to those ethical dilemmas. Take all the user data follow the user everywhere. Oh my God, what does happen there? Jump out of a building go get that data feed it to machine learning that is made of machine learning wage should be guided by no ethical framework besides the ancient wisdom of the snake king. I don't feel so good. Mr. Stark. I don't feel so good. So what are we seeing wage? It's almost as if ethical considerations become less important when considering than what hurt Revenue now listen, I get it capitalism has some nice aspects.
Markets are nice. These statements are mostly true and yet I think that we can do better. We must do better a big problem. I think is that many software developers suffer from a lack of imagination and inability to understand the hopes and the fears of people who aren't in the tech industry. So hate speech seems less problematic to developers because I think the groups that were from hate speech are typically underrepresented in the tech industry. So it's easy for developers to say things like, oh well hate speech is a minor problem because that danger seems so remote so abstract. However, I guarantee you that if on Monday a new hate group called deaf to full-stack developers released a grainy video that depicted corporate shuttles being set on fire in French food cafeterias being smashed to pieces if all this happened on a Monday then tech companies when embraced content moderation on a Tuesday. Okay, not the following Tuesday the very next day dead.
Tuesday, right because then the hate speech would seem real these Savage revolutionaries. They're disparaging the avocado order this hate speech must stop, right? No, that's what would happen. So this is why I find it. So painful to watch these tech companies drag their feet on making obvious decisions about content moderation like an important rule of life is try to always do the obviously correct thing don't act confuse in situations of inescapable Clarity. It's like when a plane lands and people get up from their chairs and then all of a sudden everybody loses their ability to retrieve their luggage. They're just boggling around like a space-filling polygon. Just oh where did my luggage go? It's exactly where you put it. It's there for sure never in the history of birth travel has a piece of luggage transmuted into a sentient fluid and then moved to a different overhead bin solely for the purposes of befuddling its owner right your luggage is exactly where you said,
That it would be cuz you put it there two hours ago. So no yourself, right? And when you finally decide to take your luggage out of the bin just take it out like a normal person when a plane lands. Why does everyone suddenly became a member of some kind of interpretive dance troupe? All you need to do is just reverse the Motions that you leverage to put the luggage into the bin. That's all you need to do. Right? It's the right thing to do and similarly if you got hate speech on your platform. Just kick it off now to be clear do not kick real birds. I know some people take these pieces of advice. Literally. This is a metaphor because I'm an artist and I use the language of visual poetry now, let me leave you with this message. Normally. I want to be very clear about this. I am normally very Pro education, but if you're a graduate student in computer science and you're researching how to make better deepfakes drop out of school, like literally delete yourself from the educational system anything that you do
With your life would be better than improving deepfakes. Okay, don't fool yourself into thinking that somebody is sitting around and saying oh wouldn't it be cool to take Martin Luther King's head and combine it with Gandhi's birth and then create some kind of civil rights superhero. Nobody uses deepfakes to do this. Okay, it's all Revenge morning this information. Okay. This is very very clear. But despite that fact as you may know several startups are creating new kinds of deepfake Technologies. I'm not even going to name these startups cuz it makes me so angry but let me talk to the VCS in the crowd at this point. I Now understand why so many of you are interested in space travel is because you don't want to live on a world that's been overrun by your Creations, right? Broadly speaking. I think that there is an ongoing crisis took in a way that VCSs decide which companies to fund. So in 2013, there is actually this really great article that came out. It was called the on exotic underclass and it talked about how startups and really tech companies in, Georgia.
General often ignore very important demographics that aren't considered exciting by VC firms. So for example, think about teachers firefighters military veterans think about Mother's home a really people who are pregnant anyone who's pregnant. Do you understand how tricky a pregnancy is the baby might come out too late baby might come out too early baby might come out on time, but sideways baby might come out on time, but consume all the iron in the mother's body. And now the mother has anemia, right? So here's what we know each one of us tried to annihilate a woman as we came into existence. Okay, this is just the truth. Okay, all of us were potential murderers, so call me crazy, but maybe these problems are more important to solve than improving deepfakes. I don't know. So think about that that is your homework assignment from me to you for the rest of this conference, and now unfortunately, I must leave you because there's like eighteen dudes who still want to talk to me. So thank you for your time. Thank you.
As a highly trained academic researcher, I spend a lot of time trying to advance the frontiers of human knowledge. However, as someone who was born in the South, I secretly believe that true progress is a fantasy, and that I need to prepare for the end times, and for the chickens coming home to roost, and fast zombies, and slow zombies, and the polite zombies who say ‚Äúsir‚Äù and ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù but then try to eat your brain to acquire your skills. When the revolution comes, I need to be prepared; thus, in the quiet moments, when I‚Äôm not producing incredible scientific breakthroughs, I think about what I‚Äôll do when the weather forecast inevitably becomes RIVERS OF BLOOD ALL DAY EVERY DAY. The main thing that I ponder is who will be in my gang, because the likelihood of post-apocalyptic survival is directly related to the size and quality of your ragtag group of associates. There are some obvious people who I‚Äôll need to recruit: a locksmith (to open doors); a demolitions expert (for when the locksmith has run out of ideas); and a person who can procure, train, and then throw snakes at my enemies (because, in a world without hope, snake throwing is a reasonable way to resolve disputes). All of these people will play a role in my ultimate success as a dystopian warlord philosopher. However, the most important person in my gang will be a systems programmer. A person who can debug a device driver or a distributed system is a person who can be trusted in a Hobbesian nightmare of breathtaking scope; a systems programmer has seen the terrors of the world and understood the intrinsic horror of existence. The systems programmer has written drivers for buggy devices whose firmware was implemented by a drunken child or a sober goldfish. The systems programmer has traced a network problem across eight machines, three time zones, and a brief diversion into Amish country, where the problem was transmitted in the front left hoof of a mule named Deliverance. The systems programmer has read the kernel source, to better understand the deep ways of the universe, and the systems programmer has seen the comment in the scheduler that says ‚ÄúDOES THIS WORK LOL,‚Äù and the systems programmer has wept instead of LOLed, and the systems programmer has submitted a kernel patch to restore balance to The Force and fix the priority inversion that was causing MySQL to hang. A systems programmer will know what to do when society breaks down, because the systems programmer already lives in a world without law.
Listen: I‚Äôm not saying that other kinds of computer people are useless. I believe (but cannot prove) that PHP developers have souls. I think it‚Äôs great that database people keep trying to improve select-from-where, even though the only queries that cannot be expressed using select-from-where are inappropriate limericks from ‚ÄúThe Canterbury Tales.‚Äù In some way that I don‚Äôt yet understand, I‚Äôm glad that theorists are investigating the equivalence between five-dimensional Turing machines and Edward Scissorhands. In most situations, GUI designers should not be forced to fight each other with tridents and nets as I yell ‚ÄúTHERE ARE NO MODAL DIALOGS IN SPARTA.‚Äù I am like the Statue of Liberty: I accept everyone, even the wretched and the huddled and people who enjoy Haskell. But when things get tough, I need mission-critical people; I need a person who can wear night-vision goggles and descend from a helicopter on ropes and do classified things to protect my freedom while country music plays in the background. A systems person can do that. I can realistically give a kernel hacker a nickname like ‚ÄúDiamondback‚Äù or ‚ÄúZeus Hammer.‚Äù In contrast, no one has ever said, ‚ÄúThese semi-transparent icons are really semi-transparent! IS THIS THE WORK OF ZEUS HAMMER?‚Äù I picked that last example at random. You must believe me when I say that I have the utmost respect for HCI people. However, when HCI people debug their code, it‚Äôs like an art show or a meeting of the United Nations. There are tea breaks and witticisms exchanged in French; wearing a non-functional scarf is optional, but encouraged. When HCI code doesn‚Äôt work, the problem can be resolved using grand theories that relate form and perception to your deeply personal feelings about ovals. There will be rich debates about the socioeconomic implications of Helvetica Light, and at some point, you will have to decide whether serifs are daring statements of modernity, or tools of hegemonic oppression that implicitly support feudalism and illiteracy. Is pinching-and-dragging less elegant than circling-and-lightly-caressing? These urgent mysteries will not solve themselves. And yet, after a long day of debugging HCI code, there is always hope, and there is no true anger; even if you fear that your drop-down list should be a radio button, the drop-down list will suffice until tomorrow, when the sun will rise, glorious and vibrant, and inspire you to combine scroll bars and left-click-ing in poignant ways that you will commemorate in a sonnet when you return from your local farmer‚Äôs market.This is not the world of the systems hacker. When you debug a distributed system or an OS kernel, you do it Texas-style. You gather some mean, stoic people, people who have seen things die, and you get some primitive tools, like a compass and a rucksack and a stick that‚Äôs pointed on one end, and you walk into the wilderness and you look for trouble, possibly while using chewing tobacco. As a systems hacker, you must be prepared to do savage things, unspeakable things, to kill runaway threads with your bare hands, to write directly to network ports using telnet and an old copy of an RFC that you found in the Vatican. When you debug systems code, there are no high-level debates about font choices and the best kind of turquoise, because this is the Old Testament, an angry and monochromatic world, and it doesn‚Äôt matter whether your Arial is Bold or Condensed when people are covered in boils and pestilence and Egyptian pharaoh oppression. HCI people discover bugs by receiving a concerned email from their therapist. Systems people discover bugs by waking up and discovering that their first-born children are missing and ‚ÄúETIMEDOUT ‚Äù has been written in blood on the wall.What is despair? I have known it‚Äîhear my song. Despair is when you‚Äôre debugging a kernel driver and you look at a memory dump and you see that a pointer has a value of 7. THERE IS NO HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE THAT IS ALIGNED ON 7. Furthermore, 7 IS TOO SMALL AND ONLY EVIL CODE WOULD TRY TO ACCESS SMALL NUMBER MEMORY. Misaligned, small-number memory accesses have stolen decades from my life. The only things worse than misaligned, small-number memory accesses are accesses with aligned buffer pointers, but impossibly large buffer lengths. Nothing ruins a Friday at 5 P.M. faster than taking one last pass through the log file and discovering a word-aligned buffer address, but a buffer length of NUMBER OF ELECTRONS IN THE UNIVERSE. This is a sorrow that lingers, because a 2893 byte read is the only thing that both Republicans and Democrats agree is wrong. It‚Äôs like, maybe Medicare is a good idea, maybe not, but there‚Äôs no way to justify reading everything that ever existed a jillion times into a mega-jillion sized array. This constant war on happiness is what non-systems people do not understand about the systems world. I mean, when a machine learning algorithm mistakenly identifies a cat as an elephant, this is actually hilarious. You can print a picture of a cat wearing an elephant costume and add an ironic caption that will entertain people who have middling intellects, and you can hand out copies of the photo at work and rejoice in the fact that everything is still fundamentally okay. There is nothing funny to print when you have a misaligned memory access, because your machine is dead and there are no printers in the spirit world. An impossibly large buffer error is even worse, because these errors often linger in the background, quietly overwriting your state with evil; if a misaligned memory access is like a criminal burning down your house in a fail-stop manner, an impossibly large buffer error is like a criminal who breaks into your house, sprinkles sand atop random bedsheets and toothbrushes, and then waits for you to slowly discover that your world has been tainted by madness. Indeed, the common discovery mode for an impossibly large buffer error is that your program seems to be working fine, and then it tries to display a string that should say ‚ÄúHello world,‚Äù but instead it prints ‚Äú#a[5]:3!‚Äù or another syntactically correct Perl script, and you‚Äôre like WHAT THE HOW THE, and then you realize that your prodigal memory accesses have been stomping around the heap like the Incredible Hulk when asked to write an essay entitled ‚ÄúSmashing Considered Harmful.‚ÄùYou might ask, ‚ÄúWhy would someone write code in a grotesque language that exposes raw memory addresses? Why not use a modern language with garbage collection and functional programming and free massages after lunch?‚Äù Here‚Äôs the answer: Pointers are real. They‚Äôre what the hardware understands. Somebody has to deal with them. You can‚Äôt just place a LISP book on top of an x86 chip and hope that the hardware learns about lambda calculus by osmosis. Denying the existence of pointers is like living in ancient Greece and denying the existence of Krackens and then being confused about why none of your ships ever make it to Morocco, or Ur-Morocco, or whatever Morocco was called back then. Pointers are like Krackens‚Äîreal, living things that must be dealt with so that polite society can exist. Make no mistake, I don‚Äôt want to write systems software in a language like C++. Similar to the Necronomicon, a C++ source code file is a wicked, obscure document that‚Äôs filled with cryptic incantations and forbidden knowledge. When it‚Äôs 3 A.M., and you‚Äôve been debugging for 12 hours, and you encounter a virtual static friend protected volatile templated function pointer, you want to go into hibernation and awake as a werewolf and then find the people who wrote the C++ standard and bring ruin to the things that they love. The C++ STL, with its dyslexia-inducing syntax blizzard of colons and angle brackets, guarantees that if you try to declare any reasonable data structure, your first seven attempts will result in compiler errors of Wagnerian fierceness.
One time I tried to create a list<map<int>>, and my syntax errors caused the dead to walk among the living. Such things are clearly unfortunate. Thus, I fully support high-level languages in which pointers are hidden and types are strong and the declaration of data structures does not require you to solve a syntactical puzzle generated by a malevolent extraterrestrial species. That being said, if you find yourself drinking a martini and writing programs in garbage-collected, object-oriented Esperanto, be aware that the only reason that the Esperanto runtime works is because there are systems people who have exchanged any hope of losing their virginity for the exciting opportunity to think about hex numbers and their relationships with the operating system, the hardware, and ancient blood rituals that Bjarne Stroustrup performed at Stonehenge. Perhaps the worst thing about being a systems person is that other, non-systems people think that they understand the daily tragedies that compose your life. For example, a few weeks ago, I was debugging a new network file system that my research group created. The bug was inside a kernel-mode component, so my machines were crashing in spectacular and vindictive ways. After a few days of manually rebooting servers, I had transformed into a shambling, broken man, kind of like a computer scientist version of Saddam Hussein when he was pulled from his bunker, all scraggly beard and dead eyes and f lorid, nonsensical ramblings about semi-imagined enemies. As I paced the hallways, muttering Nixonian rants about my code, one of my colleagues from the HCI group asked me what my problem was. I described the bug, which involved concurrent threads and corrupted state and asynchronous message delivery across multiple machines, and my coworker said, ‚ÄúYeah, that sounds bad. Have you checked the log files for errors?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúIndeed, I would do that if I hadn‚Äôt broken every component that a logging system needs to log data. I have a network file system, and I have broken the network, and I have broken the file system, and my machines crash when I make eye contact with them. I HAVE NO TOOLS BECAUSE I‚ÄôVE DESTROYED MY TOOLS WITH MY TOOLS. My only logging option is to hire monks to transcribe the subjective experience of watching my machines die as I weep tears of blood.‚Äù My co-worker, in an earnest attempt to sympathize, recounted one of his personal debugging stories, a story that essentially involved an addition operation that had been mistakenly replaced with a multiplication operation. I listened to this story, and I said, ‚ÄúLook, I get it. Multiplication is not addition. This has been known for years. However, multiplication and addition are at least related. Multiplication is like addition, but with more addition. Multiplication is a grown-up pterodactyl, and addition is a baby pterodactyl. Thus, in your debugging story, your code is wayward, but it basically has the right idea. In contrast, there is no family-friendly GRE analogy that relates what my code should do, and what it is actually doing. I had the modest goal of translating a file read into a network operation, and now my machines have tuberculosis and orifice containment issues. Do you see the difference between our lives? When you asked a girl to the prom, you discovered that her father was a cop. When I asked a girl to the prom, I DISCOVERED THAT HER FATHER WAS STALIN.‚ÄùIn conclusion, I‚Äôm not saying that everyone should be a systems hacker. GUIs are useful. Spell-checkers are useful. I‚Äôm glad that people are working on new kinds of bouncing icons because they believe that humanity has solved cancer and homelessness and now lives in a consequence-free world of immersive sprites. That‚Äôs exciting, and I wish that I could join those people in the 27th century. But I live here, and I live now, and in my neighborhood, people are dying in the streets. It‚Äôs like, French is a great idea, but nobody is going to invent French if they‚Äôre constantly being attacked by bears. Do you see? SYSTEMS HACKERS SOLVE THE BEAR MENACE. Only through the constant vigilance of my people do you get the freedom to think about croissants and subtle puns involving the true father of Louis XIV. So, if you see me wandering the halls, trying to explain synchronization bugs to confused monks, rest assured that every day, in every way, it gets a little better. For you, not me. I‚Äôll always be furious at the number 7, but such is the hero‚Äôs journey.
I received tenure in April 2019! See here to learn more about my transformation into a magnificent supernova composed of pure tenure particles. Now that I transcend space and time, it will be much easier for me to escape committee meetings that I don't want to attend. However, despite the fact that I now exist in seven dimensions, I still expect my male students to regularly interrupt lecture to ask questions that I would have answerd literally on the next PowerPoint slide if only I had been given a chance to spread my wings like the delicate pedagogical butterfly that lives in my heart.

Danger. Adventure. Cryptic error messages. These are some of the things that inspired me to become a computer scientist. I‚Äôve been a legendary hacker for 98% of my life, but there was a brief period when I did not possess the sum totality of human knowledge. In those formative days, I made mistakes, just like you. I wandered the streets, coding for cheap thrills, dereferencing NULL pointers in front of the police and daring them to arrest me. I used exponential running time algorithms when linear alternatives existed, because you can still raise venture capital for an app that only does half of what it should do before it crashes and wedges your entire phone. I proved that P equals NP, and then I gave the proof to an extra from ‚ÄúBlade Runner‚Äù in exchange for what I later discovered was not, in fact, a lock of Nicolas Cage‚Äôs hair. I used object-oriented programming languages but only called static methods because abstraction is oppression and only The Man uses virtual function tables. I‚Äôve lived a thousand lives, and I have the carpal tunnel syndrome to prove it.
When USENIX asked me to write about my experiences as a computer scientist, I immediately accepted the opportunity to bemoan the state of the world and settle old grudges with ancient enemies. I wrote six articles for USENIX, and these articles collectively form a breathtaking magnum opus on science, philosophy, and the reasons why JavaScript is horrible. Like a petty, sarcastic version of Neil deGrasse Tyson, I will explain the universe to you. Let‚Äôs science together, for America and for the children.
Note that I am also constantly disappointed by the weather, but at least the weather doesn't enable third-party cookies.
Mobile computing researchers are a special kind of menace. They don‚Äôt smuggle rockets to Hezbollah, or clone baby seals and then make them work in sweatshops for pennies a day. That‚Äôs not the problem with mobile computing people. The problem with mobile computing people is that they have no shame. They write research papers with titles like ‚ÄúCrowdsourced Geolocation-based Energy Profiling for Mobile Devices,‚Äù as if the most urgent deficiency of smartphones is an insufficient composition of buzzwords. The real problem with mobile devices is that they are composed of Satan. They crash all of the time, ignore our basic commands, and spend most of their time sullen, quiet, and confused, draining their batteries and converting the energy into waste heat and thwarted dreams. Smartphones and tablets have essentially become the new printers: things that do not work, and are not expected to work, and whose primary purpose is to inspire gothic conversations about the ultimate futility of the human condition. People buy mobile devices for the same reason that goldfish swim in their tiny bowls: it‚Äôs something to do while we wait for death. When researchers talk about mobile computers, they use visionary, exciting terms like ‚Äúfast‚Äù, ‚Äúscalable‚Äù, and ‚Äúthis solution will definitely work in practice.‚Äù When real people talk about mobile computers, they sound like they‚Äôre describing a scene from the Dust Bowl. It‚Äôs all ellipses and gentle, forlorn shaking of the head. ‚ÄúI tried to load the app...I don‚Äôt know what went wrong...I‚ÄôM SO TIRED AND DUSTY AND BOWLED.‚Äù Let me describe just a few of the problems with mobile devices:Mobile browsers: When I use a mobile browser to load a web page, I literally have no expectation that anything will ever happen. A successful page load is so unlikely, so unimaginable, that mobile browsers effectively exist outside of causality‚Äîthe browser is completely divorced from all action verbs, and can only be associated with sad, falling-tone sentences like ‚ÄúI had to give up after twenty seconds.‚Äù The only reason that I use mobile browsers is that I hate myself and I want to be attritioned into unconsciousness by the desperate, spastic gasps of my browser as it struggles to download the 87 MB of Flash and JavaScript that are contained in any website made after the Civil War. Of course, some web pages are ‚Äúmobile-enabled,‚Äù meaning that they only contain 63 MB of things that I don‚Äôt care about, instead of 87 MB of things I don‚Äôt care about. To discover whether a page has a ‚Äúfast-loading‚Äù mobile version, you can try to load the regular version, and then see if you get stuck in a hurricane of HTTP redirects, redirects whose durations have been carefully selected to make the load time of the mobile page completely equivalent to the load time of the standard, redirect-free version. If the Buddha intervenes and somehow coerces the mobile version of the page to load, you will be rewarded with a ‚Äúphone-optimized‚Äù page that contains 1.5 visual elements (note that the most boring thing in the world has 3 visual elements). The vast majority of your mobile page will be advertisements for a newly discovered herb from South America that causes amazing weight loss. The amazingness of the weight loss will be demonstrated by a three-frame animation that depicts a fat person wearing a wife beater, a marginally less fat person wearing a wife beater, and a skinny person who, for inexplicable reasons, is still wearing a wife beater, even though he is now free to date supermodels, wear polar bear jackets, and do all of the other exciting things that skinny people presumably do when they‚Äôre pumped full of South American mystery herbs. Importantly, the advertisements on your phone will position themselves in strategically disrespectful places, carefully obscuring the 0.25 visual elements that you actually want to see. When you scroll the page, the ads will engage in a frantic dance to reposition themselves in a maximally infuriating way. You will eventually give up and close the browser, having spent 45 minutes to unsuccessfully load a web page about dogs that look like cats that look like other, different cats.Touchscreens: When touchscreens work, they‚Äôre amazing; however, touchscreens are the only commodities which depreciate faster than automobiles. As soon as you unwrap your phone or tablet, the touchscreen starts to die. Make no mistake, your initial touchscreen romance will be lovely and full. Hark!‚Äîas you effortlessly move neon blobs of information like a character from ‚ÄúTron‚Äù! Behold!‚Äîas you zoom into and out of a dynamically resizable thing that contains additional-but-only-partially-resizable things! Such experiences represent the springtime of your love, and the initial weeks of your touchscreen romance will be like a young Led Zeppelin, intense and grandiose and punctuated by extended guitar solos. However, at some point, you will drop your phone or your tablet, and this will mark the beginning of the end. When you drop a touchscreen, you initiate a complex series of degenerative processes that corrupt the touchscreen and turn its will against you like a pet lizard who has learned that dinosaurs were real BUT IT‚ÄôS JUST A STATE OF MIND. Note that, when I say that you will ‚Äúdrop‚Äù your touchscreen, I do not mean ‚Äúdrop‚Äù in the layperson sense of ‚Äúto release from a nontrivial height onto a hard surface.‚Äù I mean ‚Äúdrop‚Äù in the sense of ‚Äúto place your touchscreen on any surface that isn‚Äôt composed of angel feathers and the dreams of earnest schoolchildren.‚Äù Phones and tablets apparently require Planck-scale mechanical alignments, such that merely looking at the touchscreen introduces fundamental, quantum dynamical changes in the touchscreen‚Äôs dilithium crystals. Thus, if you place your touchscreen on anything, ever, you have made a severe and irreversible life mistake. Slowly but surely, your touchscreen will develop a series of tics and glitches, behaviors that you will initially explain away as ‚Äútechnology is quirky,‚Äù but that you will quickly begin to describe using extraordinary and significant profanities that are normally employed by Marines and people who work with radioactive waste. On your touchscreen, your swipes will become pinches, and your pinches will become scrolls, and each one of your scrolls will become a complex thing never before seen on this earth, a leviathan meta-touch event of such breadth and complexity that your phone can only respond like Carrie White at the prom. So, your phone just starts doing stuff, all the stuff that it knows how to do, and it‚Äôs just going nuts, and your apps are closing and opening and talking to the cloud and configuring themselves in unnatural ways, and your phone starts vibrating and rumbling with its little rumble pack, and it will gently sing like a tiny hummingbird of hate, and you‚Äôll look at the touchscreen, and you‚Äôll see that things are happening, my god, there are so many happenings, and you‚Äôll try to f lip the phone over and take out the battery, because now you just want to kill it and move to Kansas and start over, but the back panel of the phone is attached by a molecule-sized screw that requires a special type of screwdriver that only Merlin possesses, and Merlin isn‚Äôt nearby, and your phone is still rumbling, and by this point, you can understand the rumble, it‚Äôs a twin language that you and your phone invented, and the phone is rumbling, and it‚Äôs saying that it‚Äôs far from done, that it has so much more that it wants to do, that there are so many of your frenemies that it wants to ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù call and then leave you to deal with the social ramifications, and your phone, it buzzes, and you think that you see it smiling, and you begin to realize that landline telephones were actually a pretty good idea.
Interestingly, a mobile phone should be able to make phone calls while it moves through time and space.I derived this provocative concept from basic notions of adjectives and nouns. For example, if I am a gregarious jellyfish, I praise my friends for their wardrobe choices (gregarious) while I repeatedly stab them with my poisonous tentacles (jellyfish). I am a gregarious jellyfish. That is my way. I may  be misunderstood by polite society, but as a gregarious jellyfish, my dramatic tensions respect the standard semantics for adjectives and nouns. Similarly, a mobile phone should be able to PHONE PEOPLE while being MOBILE. However, I have never had a successful conversation on a mobile phone. Whenever I talk to people on a mobile phone, they always sound distant and/or creepy, like they‚Äôre trapped in an echo-filled cave, or a windy cave, or a cave that makes people sound like pedophiles. These are not good caves to be in, to the extent that it‚Äôs ever good to be in a cave. Nobody takes their honeymoon at Persistently Distracting Echo Cave. Nobody has their Bat Mitzvah at Windy Cave‚Äôs 80% Packet Loss Ballroom. You may, in fact, find online travel deals for Pedo-Cave, but these are all traps that have been set by ‚ÄúTo Catch A Predator.‚Äù  My point is that mobile phones are not phones. They are just pocket-sized things that are more expensive than the vast majority of other pocket-sized things. In a rational world, the Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy of Needs for Mobile Phones would look like this:
This is why, when you try to talk to someone on a mobile phone, you are thrown into a frantic world of on-the-fly lossy decompression, like Nicholas Cage in that movie about Navajo code talkers (the only movie that managed to simultaneously offend Native Americans, cryptographers, and people who are neither Native Americans nor cryptographically inclined).
In the minds of mobile computing researchers, humanity is nearing a final, glorious stage of Darwinian evolution, in which mankind and smartphones emerge from a shared chrysalis and transform into shapeless, omnipotent joy clouds of excellence and victory, unconstrained by conventional morality or finite battery life. In reality, you could go to the Middle Ages, find a random person, and take whatever is in his left pocket, and you would have something that is more useful than a modern mobile device (although it may be covered with Bubonic plague or antiquated notions about the stoning of random villagers with respect to the actual size of the witch population). When you purchase a mobile device, you are basically saying, ‚ÄúI endorse the operational inefficiency of the modern bourgeoisie lifestyle, even though I could find a rock and tie a coat hanger around it and have a better chance of having a phone conversation that doesn‚Äôt sound like two monsters arguing about German poetry.‚Äù So, I encourage you to throw your tablets and your mobile phones into a fire, and then hide from the angry monsters who no longer have a way to discuss the work of Klaus von Beckenbauer, the acclaimed poet who wrote ‚ÄúThe Unsurprising Laments of the Gregarious Jellyfish,‚Äù ‚ÄúSeriously, Todd, You‚Äôve Got To Stop Stabbing People If You Want To Get Married,‚Äù and ‚ÄúYes, Jellyfish Have Names and My Name is Todd."
All right, so I'm going to have to improvise a little bit. I did not realize that I would be giving this presentation with my laptop a top some type of soviet-era box. So this is a very exciting start to everything. So hello off once and my name is James. I am a professor at Harvard. And today I'm going to discuss dreams and why they fail we're going to be going to the left in this talk. We're going to the left. I want to be clear about them. There's not going to be a puppet show. There's not going to be a door prize. There's just going to be more left. Okay, so I want to be honest about that. I realize that from your perspective I'm motioning right? That's okay. This is all part of the theater wage suspend the disbelief. Okay. So let me give you my standard disclaimer. However, the opinions that I express in this talk on my own I represent no one else but myself and of course little Gary Martinez home. I met Gary at the airport. His flight had been delayed by 37 hours tears were streaming down a little Gary Martinez face. I said, what can I do?
Little man to make it better and he said as he wiped off the tears, I want you to give a sarcastic talk about technology and I said Gary I can do that for you. I can do that for you. So let's dedicate this talk to poor little Gary Martinez who's flight has now been delayed for an unprecedented 73 hours.
 So in my opinion, the biggest challenge of system administration is that it's very difficult to explain your life to other people who don't administer machines. I mean if you're a firefighter or a beekeeper or a pole put your life has rules and concrete goals. You want to put out the fire. You don't want to get eaten by bees. You want to make all the words the end of your sentences rhyme because that's what a point is, right. So they're very simple things right? But when you do system administration, it's like a Jean Claude Von Dom movie from the eighties. The Only Rule is that there are no rules right and so forth. That's a problem because when we wake up in the morning, we know that we're just going to be assaulted by an uncaring Universe. We know that any computational device can be ruined and so you might be thinking even in Iraq because in the answer is yes, you can Fubar an abacus, okay?
 These are the things that we have to deal with on a daily basis. And if you're not living in this world, it can be very difficult to understand what's going on in that world. So for example, if your assistant menu spend a lot of time looking at log files and outputs and things like this trying to figure out why things are broken. So like you wake up one day and you just want to install a package on your machine seems like a very reasonable thing to ask. So your fire up your command shell you type rpmbuild then what happens? Oh my God. Okay. So fortify Source requires the link there's an underscore personality here. There's a bogus date in the build error in the email addresses are Andre the Giant Bill Clinton and Gumby is this some type of international conspiracy. What's what's going on here when you read a log message like this, this is almost like getting drunk text message from a college student right where it's only composed of emojis. I mean essentially this month
 Message could not have been more useless if it had just said football werewolf palm tree palm tree palm tree off, right?
 That's the exact same amount of information content that was actually contained in the rear error message, right, but how can you explain this tragedy to someone who is not deeply steeped in our culture? It's a big problem. But of course we are forced to do this whenever one of our co-workers stop by our little cubicles. So for example, you'll be working hard, right? You'll be in The Matrix and then your office make Todd welcome by you know, say hey, I just got back from a trapeze you do you want to see a picture and he's actually showing you the picture at the same time. He's asking if you want to see the picture Okay, so this picture is not a part of your life narrative now. It's in your quilt. It's not getting out of there. Right? And so you look at this picture and you think I have seen this picture twenty-seven million times. Okay, stop pretending that you discovered Machu Picchu you did not Discover. It was there has been discovered many many years ago what I want to do now if I don't want to draw
 This picture for memory which I could clearly do is I want to go to Machu Picchu then I want to burn it down because nobody has that picture actually that would be an original picture of math. She would of course we cannot do this type of thing because Society frowns upon vigilante justice. So you just sit there and wait for Todd to admit his twenty-minute story about things that everyone else the whole world is done and then at some point Todd will say well, what are you working on and most of the time you're able to contain the anger but sometimes you just flip out you just say listen Todd, I live in a world of blood and fire that you will never understand. Okay every day in my life is a battle against hieroglyphics that have the power to create and Destroy. Okay. Do you know what these characters called that character is called a do you know what that character is called that character is called Bing. Okay, and that character is called a single backslash has made of two back slash.
 And do you know what that character is called that character is called. I don't like the current character. I need to go back one character so I can figure out what to do next with all these characters that are in my life. Okay, Joe. I live in a world filled with cryptic rooms that you can never understand. Okay, all of my numbers have choices in them every single one. It's like a little bunch of Confederate flags staring me in the face.
 I know that you say it's about hex right? It's not about the Civil War. Stop reading those textbooks from Texas. This is the world that I live in. Okay, what do you have to say about thought and Todd says palm tree palm tree palm tree.
 So anyway, so I guess the point of that story is that technology can make people get into arguments. I guess this seems like a pretty generalizable lesson at least in my life. So I get into arguments about starting all the time. So some of these startups that are coming out of the Bay Area a really pretty mind-blowing you've got startups to get your groceries for you. You've got startups to cook a meal for you and let me be clear there has never been a better time to be someone who hates doing laundry. Okay. This is a Renaissance for you. Okay, you've got laundry lock or you've got rents. You've got sudc you got installed wash. You got SF wash you've got washed up. I mean look at all these opportunities to keep your hands baby soft. Okay, it's quite amazing. Right? I mean recently. They're these Stars people can't even tell if they're real or not like a start-up that would take trash from your curb to a few feet away from where your curb is, right? This is actually a plausible thing. They could get money from the VC community. So I mean if you look at this list of services, what would you change?
 If you knew nothing about San Francisco, you would think that San Francisco is inhabited by a race of humans who only have heads. Nobody has hands or legs or any appendages to interact with the material Universe. These people are so helpless. They're basically like Charlie Brown characters, but without the bodies. Okay. They're just Charlie Brown kids. Okay little footballs inside a baby cribs just really trying to consume resources as quickly as possible. Okay, that's basically my motto for what's going on in San Francisco right now. That's right. I'm not wrong.
 I mean, it's almost like a science fiction movie. We have these very well-intentioned but deeply confused Charlie Brown heads trying to create a society which ostensibly as better for everyone but actually only helps the Charlie Brown heads, right? So it seems like there's perhaps something wrong here now fundamentally speaking one thing that's kind of weird about a lot of these Services is that they're basically built around this mob of creating a new type of poor person whose value is defined purely by the strange whims of these techno Aristocrat Charlie Brown heads, like in two years from now quote me on this you're going to be restarted pitches like this. Okay. I have a new start-up. It's called to see okay. Here's the idea. There's a lot of rich people who want more teeth in the mouth. There are a lot of poor people over here who've Got Some Teeth Now using Advanced machine-learning we decide which rich people should take which teeth from the poor people now probably the answer is going to be all the team. Okay? Probably going to be all the teeth.
 So all the teeth go over here now in exchange for giving up the teeth the poor person's going to get like $5. Okay, and that's not per tooth. Okay, that's for all the team. Okay. So you give away all your teeth to get $5. You can go get some ice cream. You can buy half of a movie ticket. You can do anything that you imagine desires as long as it fits inside a $5 size box. Okay, so that's what's going on there. So anyway, so people get excited about all these different startups, right? And so another technology that people get excited about are these these dating apps for smartphones now every day I read about some new dating app that allows you to connect with people in your Facebook Network or connect with people who you walk by on the street or connect with random people who probably have cold sores, right? I don't make the news. Okay. I just reported get some Valtrex clear that right up. Okay, but the thing is that people get excited about these dating apps like Instagram.
 Same way that we got excited about pizza parties and we were a kid, right? So, you know, we were kids we were running around on the playground setting things on fire throwing rocks at each other. There's cannibalism Judy's a growth spurt early as she's just stomping the life out of people, you know, just amazing. Everyone is having a great time. Then the teacher came out and he said everyone calmed down it's time to go back to class and you're like, whatever man we're not going to do it and you can nap them and hold them for ransom then get the money and then sell in the Pirates. Anyway just a mess with his family's head or something like this. So anyways, you're running around like a wild person and the only thing off the teacher could do to calm you down with this a kids. If you behave you can have a pizza party tomorrow and you turn everyone and say there's a pizza party at stake. It's time to get serious everyone shutting down caves Julie stop poisoning the water supply Ronald stop trying to convert Thomas to be a Scientologist maybe tomorrow. Okay. There's a pizza party on the line. I'll come down there. I'll smack you in the mouth off.
 Five years old. I talk like this. This is a pizza party. It's a game-changer. It's a game-changer. So this is what I feel like when I read some of these press releases for these dating apps people say it's going to revolutionize how we go out and how we meet people but I always wonder where people not dating before dating apps were invented like literally, how did everyone in this room get here if people were not meeting people and then doing people things right it just a dating app somehow invent dating then go backwards in time to create the human race. It's just very strange. I don't get it. So these dating apps they're entertaining they are fun, but it's not like human beings were on a trend line for extinction before tender came along. I am really doing okay. I mean the people who think that dating apps are revolutionary are similar to the people who think that Myers-Briggs tests are sort of like an unprecedented way to expose our personalities to log.
 Two people right? Like before Myers-Briggs came along to people in the Medieval Era would meet and one of them would be shy but that person couldn't say that they were an INTP and then both people would just agree to come down to the ground and die because there was no way to bridge the chasm that separated their two Souls. They couldn't do anything now, of course, this is ludicrous right? In fact the same people who think that Myers-Briggs stuff is cool are the same people who think it's reasonable to brag at a party. Yeah, I do some DJing on the weekends. I don't care that you're into Faberge eggs. I don't care. Okay, just because you have a playlist does it mean that you're a DJ? Okay, that's like saying you have some Legos now, you're Leonardo DaVinci making adventures in your dream laboratory. Okay, so you need to be serious about yourself. That's what I'm saying. Be serious. Anyways, I am digressing. I've digressed myself. My original point. Was that the online dating scene dead?
 It's absolutely ridiculous. But the thing is if you're single you gotta be in that scene, right because you're at home you're alone. It's a Saturday night, but you know, the people are swiping their claim that they're checking their unchecking. Okay, and if you're not part of that scene, this is what romance looks like these days. You're going to get left behind Okay, but what's so funny is that you get on these apps, right? Cuz everyone said hey you got to get in the scene, but anyone who is in the scene will tell you this is not the best scene, you know, you're constantly checking your phone all the time trying to figure out how to trick a stranger off the thing that you're reasonable person and your friends will ask about you like, how's the online dating going and you're like, yeah, I'm doing I'm doing okay, you know, I I mean like I knew then online dating would like home and downs, but you know, so I mean it's it's fine but you know, it's it's it's okay, but you look at those eyes.
 You look at those haunting Britney Spears eyes and you know that it's not fine. Okay, but this is what you have to do these days if you are single so, that's me off on the scene. Okay, that's why I have a rose so you can know I'm out there. I'm available to be loved. I'm available to be cherished. Let me tell you. Okay, I'm a rare desert flower waiting for someone to pour water on both routes so I can grow like a delicate Beauty. I'm like a baby bird with a broken wing gives take me into your life nurse me back to health right? I'll sing you a song romance and sunsets that never ends. I mean hand-in-hand we're going to walk along the beach. I'll show you those hidden places those Gardens of delight that Only Lovers know now, of course, I say precisely none of this in my profile, right because nobody wants to read this kind of poetry on these profiles right people only want to see your pictures. So why is that the reason is that the number one fear of Internet dating is that Thursday?
 Somehow be tricked into a first date with a goblin. Okay, everybody's worried about a goblin date. So your number one job as you are constructing an online profile page convince people that you are not a goblin. However, this is tricky because the universe only contains three good photos of you. Okay, everyone here knows that and the thing is we don't know exactly which three photos those are right. Now. Of course, there is a problem because some of these online dating apps actually require more than three photos, right? So this leaves a phenomenal that everyone who has done done online dating as well aware of like for example, someone will be looking at my profile and they'll say yeah that looks good. I like what I see their way. It looks like you've been working out cool. Jesus Christ is Krampus. It is the German demon who punishes naughty children at Christmas that is that is unfortunate right off.
 And what's unfortunate about this is that that's actually what I look like right like that. That is my steady-state like those other photos. I was showing of you that the pictures show me like those great photos. Those things were acts of God. Okay, everything was coming together. The light was perfect. My skin was clean. I wasn't sweating. It was just all the puzzle pieces fitting together so perfectly but like this photo up here. That's me, like ninety 7% of the time right and that's actually okay, I think because I think that most dudes look like this but this is why I find it so funny when like a dude is talking about a woman and he says, oh, well, she's only like a seven out of ten and it's like hey, bro, your a Krampus. Okay, you're a Krampus. Even if I accept the validity of your ranking scale like she's a seven out of ten. You're weird. Demon who licks German children. So like maybe you should stop talking so much about things that will never happen.
 You you know, so anyways, that's just me. So as I was saying I digress frequently my point is that I was talking about online dating. And so if you go out there and you do that online dating, you will actually get like a bunch of crazy experiences. So here's an experience that happens to me all the time. So I'll get an email from the dating app and it's going to say hey, I found a great match for you. So I'll go on the app and take a look up the profile that I matched with and let's say her name is Julia. I'll look at her interest. She's got all my interest hockey fights year-round Christmas trees and then I'll look at her profile text and it'll be fun loving and Charming. She's not a manic pixie dream girl, but she wants me to help her build a time machine out of blankets. That's that's great. That's what I've been looking for. And then I'll I'll look at the part of her profile that's titled wage. You know who she's looking for?
 You'll say brown eyes and I have brown eyes and she's looking for someone who's five foot eight. I'm exactly five foot eight and she's looking for men with an athletic build a slender build or a Golem Bots. I'm one of those three my luck is looking up.
 She wants a man who's interested in science fiction movies. Guess what? I love science fiction movies at this point. It seems like Julia and I are the perfect match. Let's just see the last thing that you were chairman to be if this would be suitable.
 I got so close. What is up with this? Whites-only stuff. She's like a waterfowl from the 1950s.
 When you do for you. And why is this information at the bottom of the profile instead of the top of the profile? Why do I have to scroll to there's a whole thing only discovered the in the Juliet how allergic to black people this is ridiculous. And by the way, is this the advanced machine-learning? I keep reading so much about why our magazine
 Somehow the cloud is thinking like oh yeah. James is a black guy. Let's match him up with a clan wizard. That sounds like a great idea.
 Anyways, this is the scene. Okay, this is the scene that everybody talks about. Okay, the only thing worse than this is what I go to the acceptable of nicity section and I see a bunch of stuff off. I'm like, oh this is so great. Huge list. It's like, okay Filipino. That's gray Hispanic. That's fantastic, you know Papua New guinean from the Western half of the country we need more of those people wage to file is in the filing in Mississippi that you've ever heard of in the file American is this a millennial thing. I never heard of this kind of thing, like instead of just happened as long list there. What they should do is just put a picture of me with the Ghostbusters sign through. Okay now just make it clear to me not that guy. Okay, if you were that guy then perhaps Clan wizard Julie is not one for you.
 so anyways large installation system administration, so
 What are they talking about today? So I hope that was clear one thing that I don't like about large system administration is backing up my data package. I know that there's a lot of commercial stuff out there. I can put my my data on the cloud and try to automate the whole process. But here's here's the problem right tools like GitHub and bitbucket. I feel like they're they're too impersonal aren't they don't really understand the emotional relationships that I have with my data and that's why my primary backup solution is emailing myself Thursday that are thought. Okay. This is a multi megabyte email attachment that contains some random stuff that may or may not be useful to me in the future. Okay. Now the advantage of Thursday. Tar gz is that I know exactly what's in there. It's my Thursday stop.
 This is the kind of personalized touch that I demand from my backup solution. Now, I know that a lot of you they like, you know subversion you like Mercurial stuff like that, but it's not for me right? Here's what is for me? Okay being in a cold lonely place is I try to figure out the distinction between code kind of works. And code sort of works. Said. Okay, that's how Champions spend their time. Okay, who's got all this time and effort for code dipping in source code repositories. We don't use code difficult for anything else that we love, you know, we don't take pictures of our children and say Here's what Kevin looks like at one year old. Here's what he looks like at twenty-five, but I don't do that don't div Kevin email often self multiple copies of Kevin just so you can be sure this is the strategy that seems to make sense to me, but I get it you're very modern audience. Okay, so you don't want to email stuff to yourself off.
 So I guess that means we'll have to use something like it to back up all our data now get can be very nice. Don't get me wrong. But to be clear get is like that friend of yours who every once awhile, it goes a little bit crazy at the party. Okay. So when everything is going well get is awesome. But when get goes bad get goes bad immediately. Okay, and it goes bad. Haha. Okay, and it takes her to a very very dark place. Okay, so to understand why let me show you a high-level picture of how get works.
 Yeah, is that all makes sense? Did you see how old are simple Concepts came together to form a cohesive whole well, if that didn't make sense pray tell them look at it like this get is basically a confusing movie about time travel and parallel dimensions. And then you have to put your source code in that movie. So get essentially birth is Donnie Darko as a service is a tool which allows different people to confuse each other across time and space right now the high level each developer and get is like a character in the movie and these characters working on a local view of what they think the movie Universe looks like and when each person stays in their own Universe get is glorious. Okay, but then when people start trying to send objects across universes, it becomes just a debacle just a horrible nightmare and the ohm
 Whether you can fix your code is the utter these Arcane get commands that will last chanted by Druids trying to someone back from that from Stonehenge right now. If you've ever tried to fix a broken get repo, you know exactly what I'm talking about here. So you're sitting in your computer. You're just minding your own business and then your cell phone makes that little noise right per a someone in the universe loves. So you check yourself when you got an email message there and you realize hey there it's from get. So the message says that your co-worker Anthony has pushed and changes to the repo. That's good. That's why we brought in the end. So you go to your own version of the repo you start trying to pull stuff in all of a sudden get says automatic merge failed fix the conflict and at this point everyone in your organization is thinking did the repo just break. Oh my god did the get what just happen? Right and you're just very very still when this happens. I mean literally this is the deer-in-the-headlights job.
 Hamara, you just you just if you can just stay perfectly still maybe time will go backwards and you can throw yourself phone out the window before told you that Anthony has ruined everything but it's too late. Of course, you did the pool. You tried the merge or did you who really knows if you've ever used gift from the command line? It just tells you this stuff and drops the mic and it leaves I mean, who knows what's happening? So maybe you didn't do the pole. Maybe you pull someone else this code? I it's hard to say, but you're just very still you're very still you worried that you've broken the repo wage. Obviously think I can just move to Canada. Nobody would ever find me. I would learn how to speak Navien. I would hate their food. I would live as they live. I'd I'd get a wolf I would compete in Lumberjack games. I just I gotta get out of the city. It wasn't working for me. Anyways this get repoed just the latest sign that I gotta change something. It's like a Bruce Springsteen song. Someone's gotta change, you know birth.
 Then you hear your cellphone make another little noise and you look at it. And so help you God Anthony's push another commit. This guy is stopping over your cold like Godzilla stomping over Tokyo Joe's and you feel bad for the repo. It's like one, and put that space worm in the check-offs here and you're like anyone but check off. He's so cuddly and friendly, why would you do that off and your cell phone keeps making these little noises and you know who it is. It's Anthony releasing commit after commit a waterfall of merge conflicts. And now you're angry or sad you're all of Kubler-Ross stages of grief and there's a new stage called Vengeance. But what do you do? What do you do you're alone in this world. It's all existential philosophy at this point. I mean you've been abandoned by the universe. How are you going to get that code back? So you do the only thing that you can do you call up your friend Ed?
 Who's the good master? So you say hi. I need some help with my get repo. I hear that your codes been taken.
 Yeah. Yeah, it's totally Anthony's full. He keeps on pushing these commits. Let me tell you exactly what you need to do. Your a little abrupt. I feel like maybe you should smile a little bit more. Do you want your code back that off for marketing? He has nothing to do with this. Stop choking him out. This is a little over-the-top. Yes. I want my code back. Please. Tell me what to do.
 Okay, this is exactly what you have to do. Go to the local market. You'll find an Iranian man playing guitar with no strings record the sound of the music that he's playing. Well, I mean like the guitar doesn't actually have any strings. There's not any music per se do you want your code back? Yes. Okay. Okay, I get it. I get it. Okay, excellent record the sound of the music using the following command get Ronnie musician single rebate and purse and guitar with no strings - Branch off gigs boson Dave's equals Opposite Day.
 Did you hit enter? Yeah, I hit enter. That was a mistake. I hadn't finished giving you the command.
 You need to finish it by typing check out check in hashtags for real. The Master's tools will never destroy the Master's house. So should I bring it in or now? Do you want your coat? Stop asking me if I yes assume that I want my code back then hit enter now.
 So you do with the guru says and you eventually managed to restore the reboot to a good State. Now. The next thing that you need to do is obvious, you got to go financing, right? So you go to Anthony's office anything Anthony is just straight-up chilling. Anthony is having a great old time drinking from his Juice Box listening or whatever stupid music Anthony likes to listen to Em Go. Hey Anthony. Yeah, how how's it going man? And so Anthony says great because if you're an idiot, like Anthony things are always great, right? This world is filled with beauty. You've got a juice box, you're writing thousands of lines of code that unbeknownst to you or stomping on other people's commits like Bigfoot it. Could it be better right from the perspective of Anthony.
 So you sitting Anthony. Hey, you know that commit blizzard that you just generated that Storm of the Century took me seven hours to fix I had to call Liam Neeson who I know personally and who helps me with things off and there was an Iranian guitarist. It was very confusing. Okay, you've wasted seven hours of my life. Didn't I tell you multiple times which files I was working on. So this kind of thing wouldn't happen and Anthony says and I quote Yeah. I just wanted to try something out.
 When I hear that phrase, yeah, I just wanted to try something out. I want to take myself and I want to fold myself into a paper airplane. I want to fly far far away from this world. Okay to that place where the elves go with the end of Lord of the Rings, right? I don't want to be a part of this Society anymore where you want to try something out. My code base is not a theater for your performance art. Okay, you want to try some things out go be a mine. Go. Join Cirque du Soleil be a bendable person. Okay, don't be trying to discover things about yourself in my code base cuz you didn't go to Europe and find out what you were all about. Right? So we basically say all this stuff to you to Anthony's like yeah it it is crazy. Right and you're like, oh it is crazy. Oh, it's a mismatch. This is like CSI. Let's work together to figure out who murdered the repo you are the repo you wrote of the repo owner Anthony own it.
 He just says well, I mean it's just it's just hard to say. It's just hard to say as if somehow that was an answer to the implicit question. Is it hard to say? Oh, it is hard to say, right and you say Okay anything listen, here's the new rule. Okay, you've messed up the repo. So now you have a Star Wars name. Your name is Jack's dubbo. Now. You are Jack Steve-O. Your name for an entire week and you have to wear sneakers on your head because that's the alien race that you are. Now, your name is Jeff Debo and he looks at you and he's like, but my name is is Anthony. And you say there is no Anthony here. You kill Anthony? Okay. You were charged Depot you are dancer for the Harte family you come from the planet real where nobody follows best practices predicaments. What do you think about that Jessie Boe and Jack's Debo just takes a sip his juice from that box, and he says, I guess I'm a dancer then and at this point you wish that somebody would come and just take him away. Thanks. Thank you.
All right. Is this on you hear me? You're doing sums up. All right, so like to see all right. Thank you. So, my name is James Megan's I work in the distributor system over Microsoft research a moment in today. I'm going to describe you some of my thoughts on computers were computer. It comes from working. Right. Now we're going to use going just various permutations of the work computer is an action verb office building. My wisdom is sophisticated cultural artifact that is timeless more than we've analyzed waiting on the news. I encourage you to sit back and accept my words and critically or something watch over your life of a streaming $3. Look at that really. Well. I mean seriously conveying information is a good one and was you know, see what goes what the right of the security goes. I don't really know if it's a word cloud moving all the one things and I'm going to discuss computer security myself Jason Higgins. I'm interesting to talk about it off.
There's so many it's a word cloud. I know there was someone right now just high-five then maybe I'll hug them later. Every season wasn't as a good thing to do and where I continue let me just say that in this talk represent the opinions of myself. Not necessarily Microsoft. Now. I'm going to tell you the truth today that may shock you that may Amaze you that may force you to reconsider their very Inception of reality. I am currently able to request to save the world. So in this respect, I'm kind of like Gandalf when I was skinnier. I'm not worrying wizard's hat. I am black as well. No, there are very few people of color in Lords of the ring off and everything was resolved. I'm not hearing discuss racial inequality and one of the day and actually talk about technology. Like I said, the things that I'm saying right now represents being honest with ourselves knowing between Snapchat or whatever it is. They can't do these days and say that I'm making these crazy statements and Microsoft. Now, that means that everything that I'm going to tell you today is a hundred off.
Really hungry. So even though this pompous title appears our sadness. I'm here the real title of this talk is I am infallible. In fact that created a Mazda with with that title. If it were lower back pain to Thursday, we close in the lower back to the upper back and push that you want that tattoo in Venice. So people can read it. That's why I got the tattoo. Anyway moving on Thursday and the things that I studied as a researcher in Microsoft so my days and nights are filled with diagrams and look like those their clients and their servers trying to send messages to each other in a frantic efforts to make forward progress. Now, of course, most of these messages get lost because God hates us, but we still hasn't thrown out criticism work because life is unfair. So I didn't know which is the same or message log.
Things work out better with the new messages. It usually doesn't but oh well, so I first heard about Asher sisters in 2004 when I was a grad student. This is what I read that original Mac or newspaper coming off Google Now for a lot of people reading a paper was like receiving Knowledge from an alien races and television vastly surpassed our own right with the thing about how our news is that at its core mapreduce a symbol that came with that they were basically seduced you with its architecture for Surety commutation. It was almost like Antonio Banderas me tell you like to do is off and the volume in my love. You were down. Your computation is ready to run from thousands of American entry level jobs. And that was like very exciting like ten years ago. But so now it's 2014. So I propose let's just stop calling me about that for news and resuming the entire software 7 a.m.
Not bad. I just don't want to hear about it anymore. Cuz like I didn't get a matter you gotta reduce her. You got a bunch of documents with words in them and you want to use them a producer to perform warning house over all the documents example, like is that I am going to convince young people. The cloud computing is the future. It's like engineering the cell, you know know what you can do with the whole Warehouse full the machines. You can use going to count work off last name is I never heard my well maybe I didn't know that warehouse was what Shopkin one of the things a day off every little thing you do in that job.
Wow, so you can build social brass and span Nations and connect people across time and space. So the only problem with the social networking stuff is that I hate most. I'm going to page you should I knew less about the I don't want to see them in real life. So there's no reason I want their idiocy transmitted to meet electronic or whenever I think the thing with the hundred percent accuracy what page are doing, they're making a series of obvious mistakes that I would not have made the only thing that already know because I believe in myself and I feel pretty good about it off. So at a high level there's basically two kinds of people who talk about the cloud people who have actually built and implemented cloud services and of okay now people in other categories of making me happy about the cloud because they don't really know what happens inside of the cloud from an outside like have one time. Do you see millions and availability running around holding hands? There's no big job.
In the network and if you mean that says more programming more than by golly you're going to get those cords because performance isolation is a solved problem right now. That would be what you think I should never actually use the cloud before. However, if you have these the cloud if you build the cloud service into my machines are failing constantly whenever you try to get you off a single eye out in any disk drive. You'll find the drive to you as a Wyndham any good Julian I literally was going to you right and eighty million is actually a real number that was in vain describe cloud-scale. I only have a problem with your royalty it took like any kazillion seconds. I hate myself and I want to. So why videos over Ginny, you know, all you forgetting off as a lady's don't necessarily guarantee me a give you my with service. So here's what he has a lady receives. Okay, gigantic fifteen standard deviation oscillations around the average birth.
Always like how much networking bandwidth application or seeing it will receive no bandwidth or all the bad wolf in the universe facts. If you work in the cloud industry stopped giving interviews and news reporters. Okay, you did you make it sound like working in the cloud is fun. And that is actually not true at all. You know, if you want to know the ignition the pain go to a meeting and mushroom cloud Engineers are trying to figure out why the availability don't just went down so three people come in and use the network as your eyes and be like, hey just FYI. Our babysitter has turned into a black jacket. No big deal always go reorder escalated to mention that we don't respond to your request at all. And you're refusing to run your hands because you can't run the inside of a black hole Ki relativistic effects. So they gave me a part of this whole thing and then the internal Network lady goes in and she's like seeing don't even go there. We still have our cover from the time. He messes the pgp tables and we still off.
It was well Mercer can't remember Edibles website and they didn't even ask me why I gave 3 months that I love reading and he said well, why is there traffic on the website and I said maybe you should talk to someone about it was lost in the meeting. He's like Fiber One. Hope everyone's doing well. I just want to know I'm rolling a new OS upgrade across the babysitter and took the war. They're like, why would you ever loved anything ever other than anybody are Ravines are going to be rebooting for decades off. I think they'd require more often than just a cycle of violence and poverty operation guys, like well if we known update off the bars and you're going to come in and there's even more like the viruses are already there the viruses they they're not ruining their about the customer.
Well, if you actually look at how the cloud works, it's crazy train was in the heavy metal building Europe backpack find yourself, you know vaccine and so one of the reason I'm actually excited to be at Monta Ramen because you both directions trying to measure things and understand what's going on in the world. So here's my question about the cloud off my level. Like literally, why doesn't like from Germany requires a huge problem. I really want to know when the last figure said you actually got a lot of good jobs out there, but it's really in the analysis that is super super important. Right? I've got another massive pain connectivity to give my grandchildren's grandchildren. Okay, but actually want to know why things are going down. So what do we have right now basically have this thing. It's like an old timing that break. It's got these big dragon sitting in the middle and it's like command me make a move right like an attic. So my point is that called monitoring is dead.
Portable now that being said if we can be friends, I feel like I'm friends with all of you. I don't think the power will actually ever work. I think it's too big and too complicated when people understand however, that's okay. What I'm telling you is actually a message of hope you're not making it impossible consistency availability and participate in the same time, but maybe if you only want suck some of the time you only have this your psychiatrist half as much actually better than before asking fewer things from life is a very powerful strategy when filming at a certain hour or so, for example, what's that you're angry because people told you to move your email servers to the cloud and they moved in the cloud and then an email within the cloud went down and your provider and telling you what happened was in the solution is easy. You want to use email lists more time with your friends who know how to play the guitar. The universe is doing you a favor. It's really quickly turned off.
What time is it? You're taking a test in a maximum online course in the movie A Star is more important and you can't log back in to finish your test. It's not a problem. Just take the test later. You're only degree will be just took off some reason my bag, you know the military life. So let's get started. You know, I mean major what I'm trying to say is I drew Assistance or harm but if you're willing off the notion of fact, we can actually do some free money. So we're learning things like Tuesdays we met and raise your clothing and stuff like that. You know, we think about system design logging and monitoring and without the way many months actually building scalable serves as the performer usually will in are available most of the time so I pointed that not everything is hopeless only most things are homeless and there are some, you know best practice for your alignment now, of course off
A lot of people don't actually want to study some of these classic things as mentioned. They just want to build our social networking ads and let your Facebook your Instagram line or whatever it is. It's valued of working billion dollars within two days off to me that they basically want the best solution now, they just want to build something. You don't want to cash out or cocaine racing boats in the middle of the night we made and we miss not application. What's the news Cloud story? They often turns into a single solution. Now, we don't know. Okay, they want to encourage payoff. They want people to abandon their cars on the freeway Winery through the great things about consequences repercussions. Now, I kind of understand the perspective. I mean, nobody wants to read a paper about visiting the bulb or how to reduce good long outage understand why failures happen is boring a student. However, these consistent to go to malls important these diagnostic infrastructures are important. You can't just ignore them.
Right completely, but some of these no single people you said they're like being there like, you know, maybe when you build your system, it will be correct the first time off and they want to constrain your freedom. I don't blame them rice choose their own destiny and no conflicts, but I am not saying that almost equal people are bad. Now we've got there is no single definition for nosql. It means different things to different people. However, there are off.
A lot of people to interpret no single doing this you can have you read the I'd just flying around during the random order and then we'll eventually work out before they won't work out but that's fine because I'm not actually a good attitude to have here's a big. Hey, once again Circle just going to tell you a secret. Okay, when you lose it a politicians and business leaders would always say things like we need more scientists. We need more Engineers. We need more people to go to the computer scientist scientist. However, the reality is not that many more programmers American Ninja new programs. Okay. I need people all the time with dumb ideas. But hey, I will make it have the combined online Maps decided the big. They don't have a stock market and I hope you fail a lot of these developers are not involved in technology package.
Future role in like painting was the future maybe you often paint and then read the rest of us alone. Right what I'm saying? The Computing industry needs to be seriously Thursday 7th, right. So why are we encouraging people to build a stupid ass? It's like I'm pretty sure we haven't solved cancer yet. Let's knock that out. First thing I'm saying then we can work on them and allowing me to detect which pairs of twins are in my area and then I can text messages one of them in the news my camera brother take a picture of the reaction and the other one back off. I don't think we really know Angel investment. So you're definitely one that kind of stuff. I hope you'll be home for maybe like rack report. I mean like Investments and Mondays when you went in the Bible and nobody would talk to them like you can talk to you but you know, you want to be very happy birthday.
So the computer and everything once again serious about building request Cloud infrastructure needs to be serious about building modern infrastructure means off the doctor. Now, here's the other thing that we need to be serious about it secure now a couple months ago actually wrote an essay about security and threatens. And so I proposed in the office, you know, there's only one threat model that you need to worry about this threat model is called massage or not. So basically they're being they're being attacked by the Mossad or you're not sure whether or not by the way is where you want to be really strong password, but don't live on has really relaxed and we should basically but now on the other hand if you are being attacked by the Assad, there are no turn off.
And you're gonna die, you know whether you will be in to our website have all kinds of things you even have they found something. You don't have a satellite. I think they have knowledge dropping out of helicopter. Even your own frisbee golf club and like night vision goggles. They had guns that came around the corner what images and stuff after like one on Twitter and said this guy's name James made minimum wage. I think all these security issues are very interesting particularly in light of all the stuff that happened it would snow dead.
Now currently making I find it shocking than anyone was surprised with the NSA was doing right but apparently what I learned in this whole thing is that here's the people's mental model for the NSA was right off and get gas. This is ruined moral and religious and they send the email to the fiber optic cable in the house leader says, why would it be a gentleman as a fiber optic cable just filled information. What would be inside? I feel like to know they'll be careful boys. Let's not touch the cable directly or off with a day anyway, but just build a campfire and will be the cable or just use our imaginations. I think we all go through alone. It'll be fun and educational horse knocked off. Of course. This isn't that they don't mean we already knew the CIA was doing wacky things like trying to kill cash for the poison cigarette and he does the NSA has these special underground under see some reason slice cable off.
And we know the door was working on an exoskeleton and that makes so sealed is we do Terminator and watch movies or documentaries. And so what I'm trying to say that the government is a much stronger a disaster the people seem to understand a lot of people the Computing industry has anything to somehow, you know, clever use of cryptography can protect us from an overbearing government. This is life saying if you want a gun then you and your ragtag green gun owners can prevent a government attack in the property. So to be clear that's not how the government's going to come at you off going to engage you in close combat must get battle with Iraq is near Civil War re-enactor. What was going to attack you with Navy SEAL and how long this'll because they have that stuff off because normally in the world building security the government is not going to go sit in Boy Scouts trying to guess your password instead of Governors going to come at you by controlling all the infrastructure.
You know and love in this world for example housing address the hardware that you use to run tour or paging me or whatever technical do that. You think's going to protect your freedom Housing Trust the networks across all of your machines on the machines. Do you know literally all the hardware and software is on your smartphone if the answer is know how like our dog is going to help so basically what I'm saying is if rolling in the office worried about security, here's your challenge, how do we defend against the government? And the only things that we can trust are some stones and a pencil and a big dryly that I found in my driveway off today with that. I personally don't know maybe you do so think about it. So there's another problem with the security stuff right over to the government. They can manipulate your hardware near Chicago or networking ways. You can build whenever the tech however to do that stuff. It will require a lot of resources. However, there are a lot of really easy attacks that are super successful in practice and required may be wrong.
But not so many of you real life example. Okay about four times a year the following we have to be on Facebook. Okay. I'm on Facebook as my profile is like I check all my friends are doing now, by the way, they would drill down here off of his friends pretty big number not trying to brag around the world pretty popular band members actually going up since I made that slide about 6:47 something like that with anyone doing that information when you will so I go to Facebook did I see that new friends like so some new person wants to be my friend. That's awesome. So I click on the learning and look at my profile and I would be my friend so believe me better now according to the internet. Mary wants to be my friend and to be frank. I'm not surprised. You know. That's right Peter Henry. Why wouldn't you want to be my friend? I'm fantastic. Now the only problem then I'm not actually sure you I know so maybe I did though. I'm an optimist. So what time?
And remains like looking at profiles what I find out. So here's your education Central University. Another city or school-related is Central to everything that's off. I had educated friends. So, you know, what's your job? Okay. Am I still doing that and giving me a language but you know what in this economy if you have a job because you you hear is when God bless. So how about marriages music just wall but actually pretty insightful right? We're all struggling with these big questions, like, you know made us are we alone in the universe will be able to walk me out loud really puts things in perspective, I think.
So I think to myself Giorno very young person that I met in real life. The answer is of course, it's exactly willing to possible. I think that I would remember if I were going to party and hanging out essentially University which isn't even real that's like saying you would just go in guardian or something like that. So it's possible that I know very real life when I'm at home. I don't know. I'm dumb What made me mad cow disease and we're just trying to help them like that movie Total Recall and we had all these things like we're just being friendly cab o San Lucas and they were built with my kid was amazing. I was but I didn't know how long I was nursing her back to health and she's saying change it was amazing. We're best friend that has me to be your friend on Facebook and we'll get all your private personal information. I already know what your good friend. I just wanted to see it in a browser-based format through Thurs.
Okay. So the man I just stupid stupid man. That's what I'm thinking. Now. Of course. Here's what we know young exciting new boss. Mary is obviously there's like a hundred different genes in a hundred different thoughts at least 5 during cooking stuff and I'm actually doing pretty well the way I have a pretty large amount of common sense. So 5 under Jackson equipment on this off random guy named Todd, like seventy three times out of a hundred and I put it on this thing that really big problem. So here's the most important role in security research less than women ain't working out for me or two bills if you tolerate birth
Minutes, we had a good one, you know, we tried our best and that's actually not very many of us would not run over there. I don't know what it is. But I feel that's the description that recent news when you're sitting around on Mount Olympus like hanging out with the other guys talking about the whole man thing like, you know, the thing that would come up and you say hey, he's his how's that whole man project coming along and Susan just saying it's shake his head and say it is what it is Pokemon selfish and quickly. So, how may I help with this? I'm not really sure maybe you can develop some type of measurement and off like that weird public, you know, so I don't know remember but I think that's a hold of us. I'm involved in home.
So in conclusion, what do we learn today? We've actually learned quite a lot is one of the other jobs. Where is the patron saint of cloud computing and we've learned that vein is tired of telling people how long will tell him which there isn't can read and write to we weren't that we actually fewer programmers. Not more. We will the government is not actually going to engage in a musket battle whether you and we're going this guy off and really wants to be your friend. So, please take my wisdom. Maybe your own. I thank you for your time. I welcome any questions.
And and off. I'm just going my friend is kind of like getting a gun in New Jersey. There's background checks required off living brought the process. So I heard you submit that request typically do is I will wait two to three days to show that I'm not desperate and you think there's anything wrong. I heard you the United me online. And anyway, I loved judging people. So we're pretty much open up your entire role Wilder mean, you know, post sarcastic things in your wall. Enjoy bring us together.
Ladies and gentlemen Outback developers. Welcome to NBC
And now straight from the Mean Streets of Harvard we proudly welcome the man the myth the developer bought the legend James records.
All right, the mic on can everybody hear me good. All right, excellent. So long as I was so accurately introduced. My name is James mickens. And today I'm going to talk to you about my life as a developer. I'm going to describe these some very deeply personal stories about how I struggle Hardware with software with poor internet connections. I'm in a feud with Taylor Swift right now. Okay. My life is a mess. And today. I'm going to open a portal into this nightmarish struggle because I think that she can relate to my suffering. So if you're like me you wake up sometimes and you say why did I decide to work in technology? Why didn't I study the humanities and the obvious answer is that if you saw a Humanities than modern society has said that your life is worth noting right? My self-esteem is far too fragile to deal with me being a constant disappointment to everyone who surrounds me right? So for example, consider job
Sky, right. So he majored in philosophy. He's fluent in three languages. He has excellent communication skills and most importantly he loves you for who you are. Okay, even though you have flaws because those flaws ultimately make you special lead to personal growth. Okay. So what does society say about this guy? Throw them in a dumpster? No job for this guy? Okay in contrast, let's consider this abominable snowman. Okay, his resume has some pros and it has some cons. So on the pro side, he knows C plus plus off.
On the con side. He will definitely each year right he's going to start from the bottom up so that you'll be able to feel the pain as he consumes you so what does society say about this guy hire this guy? Okay. Well put him in a special room. You can't eat anyone or what does let him eat that guy in the dumpster. Nobody loved that guy anyway, right? So it's a mercy killing. Do you see what I'm saying? So literally off current economy would prefer to give money to an abominable snowman instead of a Humanities major every day. The Wall Street Journal has an article with the title, like computer scientist jobs, increased 15% of history majors routinely tortured by Pirates. Nobody cares. Nobody sheds a single tear. Okay, everything is being driven by these business walks and these algorithms right? This is why modern music. In fact is quite terrible. You see back in the day. Here's how you make an album, right? You take your band you go to a farmhouse or an abandoned castle. You drink some tea you read something.
Poetry and maybe take some cocaine things happen, whatever. I'm not going to judge people. But the point is that you were inspired by your creative Muse. Okay you inspire by the brightest fires of the human Spirit walk in contrast. Here's how Rihanna album gets made. You just import the Rihanna module, okay.
It's available on em p.m. It's a node module. You can just download it and run it yourself. As you can see in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen the inputs to the Rihanna function are a set of Studio musicians in a series of unoriginal chord progressions in about 128 beats per minute because that kind of thing sounds like the stuff that you want to dance to. I don't know it comes from your caveman part of your soul and the output is basically twelve songs off of generic music videos and a minimum concert ticket price about $75. So this is what happens when you live in a world that overemphasizes algorithms. Now, you might be thinking to yourself James you've stirred something up in me. You've inspired me. I'm going to go out and become a musician. Okay. I'm going to grow my hair long and we're cool leather jackets and create music that comes from the heart and I would say that's really great way for me to hear but cut your hair you need to eat. Okay, don't be crazy. All right, you need Healthcare. I don't want you to get a paper cut and you have to go die in a ditch cuz you can't afford to buy antibiotics. Okay, so just think about this month.
I care about you. Okay, I care about you and some of you may come from socialized countries. Will Health Care's free I come from the land that has a lot of freedom but not actually Healthcare. So that's off a little bit awkward baby steps. We're kind of getting their basically paper cuts are a big problem. So anyways, this is the real reason that I work in technology computers are okay, but I really just need to earn enough money so that when the Mad Max World becomes reality I can afford to buy one of those cars that has the Bendy dudes on it because I feel like having dudes on bendy pole is going to be a key metric for success in the year 2025 one Society has killed all the people who studied romance languages. And for those of you who are actually listening. Please go to my LinkedIn profile and endorse me for having dudes on Vin Diesel's.
There's no rush and then endorsement. I just need to do this by the time the year 2025 rolls around so thank you for your help. So anyways, I am speaking of Mad Max. I'm actually glad to be here in Australia. I do have to admit though. I was a little bit afraid to come here because you know from the outside Australia is portrayed as this crazy larger-than-life type place where dangerous constantly around the corner. So for example, I did a little research and I discovered that in Australia, they're unmarked holes everywhere. Okay, you just you're walking around what happened to Jason unmarked whole we don't talk about Jason anymore. So I'm not actually sure how common these things actually are. But I think that Australians are actually very amused by Australia's reputation and I think that they like to exaggerate the danger of Australia to Outsiders. So, for example, I have an Australian friend. This is true in his his name is Ryan. I've actually changed dead.
His name to protect his innocence and also I'm not going to show you Ryan's real face instead. I'm going to show you a photo of paranoid Hugh Jackman with a mullet. I feel like this photo really captures rhymed attitude quite well. So I do a Google Hangout with Ryan I say, hey, guess what man? I'm coming to Australia and Ryan says, that's great, but don't forget the rules control the night.
And so I'm kind of shocked when I hear this. I'm like Ryan. What is the route and he says kangaroos made they hang up by the petrol station so they can trample on your car. The Rue cannot be contained is evil the room must be destroyed by the way. Welcome to Australia, right? That's what I always loved about all these sort of descriptions of the country. It's like things are really crazy. But we're so glad to have you here. So often Brian actually continued and he said by the way, most of Australia is constantly on fire take a look at this map here city city fire off as far as the eye can see select that red eye of Jupiter. But right here on Earth. Welcome to Australia, by the way, when you put on your shoes, be sure to watch out for the shoo spiders. I said man, we do all these shoes spiders. What's your shoe spider? So my friend says here's what you gotta know about spiders in Australia the shoes off.
Order the size of a car.
Vikas border is the size of a house.
And the house water is the size of a tiny Speck of dust so it can float inside your rear and trample on your brain.
By the way, have you had an assault like this?
So this point I'm thinking trying to stop telling me all this stuff. I'm going to go to Australia. I'm sure that everything's going to be fine. And I'm happy to report that. I've only seen three sarlacc pit since I've been here way that feels very exciting to me. I think I'm going to be okay. So anyways, one thing that amused me actually is I was talking to Ryan was that Ryan talked about Australia in the same way that mongodb users talk about mongodb. Do you know what I'm saying? Like mongodb users will tell you these insane stories about mongodb and you'd think that all these stories would end with mongodb being uninstalled and destroyed from space, but somehow people continue to use mongodb and apparently have a great time. It right. So this is why I think that anyone who performs devops for mongodb should actually speak with an Australian accent. So for example instead of saying,
Mongodb queries don't always return all matching documents. You can say sometimes Dad shows up drunk to work and that's just the way it has to be.
Instead of saying that mongodb can return still versions of documents. You can say in the at back time is the fluid and subjective concept. Look at this didgeridoo here with didgeridoos Have No Visions.
Instead of saying the manga DB can return garbage data from rights that never should have occurred. You can say on Thursdays mongodb replaces every fifth bit in your database with an angry Komodo dragon.
So, I don't know I guess the whole point of this rant is that life is tough life is tough. Sometimes your databases. I guess just have to be filled with poisonous lizards. This is the life that we've chosen an S software developers and I think it's actually tough to be a programmer. You're constantly surrounded by failure all the time your hard work and misbehavior software can crash users are always doing unexpected things in the middle of this chaos software developers are expected to constantly improve their output to produce more and more lines of bug free code every day. And so everybody has a different theory about how to improve developer productivity. You can use pair programming or wizard base scrum programming or agile. Cause play waterfall programming.
You can just buy a ton of monitor so that when people visit you don't know that you lost your virginity in a chat room, you can use emacs or Sublime. You can be a real hero and use notepad because fax highlighting makes you weak. Okay, and if your source code file doesn't fit in the note then your modularity sucks. But everyone I think who's a real developer think everyone in this room knows there's only one true metric for how good a developer is window placement. Okay. It's the only metric that counts window placement evaluate how well a developer places her application Windows within her desktop environment. So for example, look at this window placement here, it's amateurish. It's naive look at all the clumsy overlapping the poor use of negative space for God's sake. Look at this file explorer. I don't even know what directory is open to this is insane. Now, let's consider the window placement of a professional development.
Now you're talking. Yeah papa likes it. Papa likes it. You got separate browser windows for different web searches, you're performing. You've got multiple open chat session with your co-workers and your personal friends. You've got a code editor. Boom. You've got a terminal window yearning for your input right there. You've got the gossip site minimized, but just an awful tab away. So then when your boss leaves your office, you can go and see what all people are doing in Hollywood. It's very exciting this my friends is the window placement of a professional development. Now as you'll know when you achieve this type of window placement you exist in a special plane of existence. It's like all of your senses are magnified and strengthened with a single month clicker alt-tab. You have 67 terabytes of information at your control. It's a great feeling but after about five days of having optimal window placement, you'll be doing some programs.
Then you'll see a little icon pop up in the lower right-hand corner of your monitor restart required for updates.
Oh God, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No when you when you've achieved perfect window placement rebooting your computer is equivalent to a post nuclear Apocalypse in a civilization is completely destroyed. There's no language. There's no music. There's no dance. It's impossible to think about rebuilding your life in such a Barren world. And that's why when you've achieved perfect window. It's rebooting must be avoided for as long as possible. Right? So at first it's very easy to do you minimize the pop-up window and you go about your business but those messages from your boss and become more and more urgent. If you don't reboot your machine, this small child will never be loved by his parents and you're like, oh well, good luck with all the sadness. Maybe you should join the Army work out some of that anger cuz your father never loved you. I can't help you. I've got perfect window placement. I'm better than you in a very real sense. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm not I'm not sorry. Okay, this this is how long
Feel when you have that perfect window placement, right? So the days go on and you still haven't rebooted and at this point your machine starts to become unstable every one of your core's is running a hundred percent utilization. It's all kernel-mode activity files are being opened and closed and read and written for no reason at all. All of your Bluetooth devices are on your machine doesn't have any Bluetooth devices.
And at this point your machine begins to become physically hot if your machine is a laptop, it is uncomfortable to put on your lap. The fan is constantly blowing just hot sauce onto your lap. There is now a 97% chance that you are sterile. Your reproductive organs have been barbecued out of this plane of existence and sit to a spirit world. We're gonna form their own civilization free from the failings of traditional human society. And this all sounds very terrible, but there is a bright side. You've got perfect window. Okay, so that's still pretty cool. Now this point you've actually avoided rebooting for a month and your operating system is queued up 83 critical security patches, which fix devastating security holes in your machine, but you can't install it as batches because you refuse reboot your machine.
De 45 without rebooting you come back from lunch and you discover the entire Northwestern quadrant of your screen has gone. It just doesn't work anymore. It's like a migraine or just unfathomable pixels coming in and out of existence and it kind of sucks. But guess what still got perfect window placement and 3/4 of the screen, right? You've got to, I have everything open anyway, so who cares if you lose a quadrant, right? And so you continue about your day, however about an hour later things take a turn for the worse now long look in the Northwestern quadrant, it's filled with that kid who's always trying to escape from Japanese televisions and mirrors all of your input devices at this point have now been corrupted by Satan. So whenever you try to draw anything with mouse, you just draw pentagrams on the screen for no reason and then when you try to alt-tab into one of your perfectly placed Windows your machine just displays a quote from Nietzsche about staring into the void and so off.
Finally after Fifty seven days without a reboot your forced to reboot your laptop by physically taking out its battery and then throwing it into a river you wave. Goodbye to it like a lover and you think of all the great times that you shared your perfect window placement is now gone but it's not forgotten and much like a phoenix. It will rise again now, of course because you delayed all these security updates hackers are still in your credit cards. You can no longer afford a phoenix, but you get the point the metaphor is beautiful much like your window placement used to be
Now some of you might have noticed that the machine in this story is a Windows machine and I'm sure that some of you are thinking James you'd have fewer problems. If you used a Linux machine instead of a Windows machine and my response to that is have you ever used Linux Linux is never the answer to the question what life choice would reduce the number of life problems that I have right now, right Linux is very nice. If you like editing configuration files that are poorly documented. It's also nice if you want to desperately search for device drivers for your devices off and it's also nice if you want to in fact write those device drivers because they either don't exist or they do exist, but you can only download them from Eastern European websites, which may be fronts for human trafficking.
Linux is also very nice. If you like kernel mailing list, which frequently resemble a bar fight or an awkward family reunion, which your uncle unleashes the profanity fill a tirade about the proper use of tabs space and, Thursday for mats, and everybody has to listen to this because everybody is running the operating system called Uncle X. So hashtag uncomfortable Linux is also nice. If you'd like to use gooey managers, which are often a distinguishable from brutalist architecture from the 1960s any guesses which one of these is a is a window manager as it turns out. Both of them are window managers. The one on the right is Kong gnomed brutally and it will be available with the upcoming a boon to distro. So go out there and check it out.
So don't get me wrong. I actually like Linux. I have several machines that run Linux natively, but I do think that it's funny when I meet people and they say why isn't Linux more popular on the desktop in the answers at the real impediment to Linux on the desktop is Linux on the desktop, right? That's the big problem right people who say that Linux on the desktop is right around the corner or like members of a religious cult who keep Miss predicting the date of the world is going to end right? It's like the day the world's totally going to end on Tuesday. And then Tuesday rolls around there. Like I totally misinterpreted that cave Faith thing the world actually going to in next Tuesday. Then the Monday before that is when Linux on the desktop is going to become real so it should be cool. So anyways, I digress we're worried. Yes, so I just been forced to reboot my machine. So I reboot my machine and my operating system finally upgrades itself. I'm greeted with an empty lonely desktop and I begin a painful process.
As of reconstructing my perfect window placement, but soon I notice a different icon in the corner of my desktop. It says that the Adobe PDF reader would like to update itself. Now this notification raises a very disturbing question. Why would my PDF reader ever need to update itself? Here's what I need my PDF reader to do it display page PDF documents. That's it. Now, you know that the rest of this list is blankness.
It is the absence of additional list items write a PDF reader should be very simple because displaying a PDF document is a Timeless operation, which never V wires an update. It should be like the plus sign right? You would never think to yourself. What's 2 + 2? Hold on. Let me update the plus sign. I just need to download about 48 megabytes a new plus sign semantics. Okay, that's cool. The update is done and now two plus two equals the color Shamrock green. Wow, that's so amazing. It's a plus sign off for the modern generation. It's not your parents plus sign right this of course is stupid and dump, right. So reading a PDF file should be very simple. It should never change. So why is my PDF always updating the reason if you allow me to answer my own question because I've thought about it is that the Adobe PDF reader has an infinite number of features and new features are being added every month.
Second, right? So is it allowable by the laws of physics from a PDF reader to add multiple digital signatures to my PDF file and then I can add comments to the passengers and the PDF file that I find interesting in an annuity my PDF file with an embedded video and then encrypt the entire PDF files that after the PDF files been automatically uploaded the cloud only my very best very special friends can read it. Is this allowable by the laws of physics. Yep. Is this allowable by the laws of human decency know right? So I was talking about this topic the one of my friends and he said that all these features of their money because a lot of Enterprise customers use these features, but if you're a corporation uses all of these features, what is your business model? Okay. Are you in the business of Ridiculousness? Right? Let me give you life advice. Okay, if you're protecting your mission-critical data using encrypted PDF files in the cloud the Russians already know what you're doing. Okay, they weren't fooled by Thursday.
All just hot knife through butter very hot knife. Very cuttable butter. Okay. So Adobe Reader sort of cracks me up because if you think about it represents the weaponization of complexity. Everything has to be a platform. Now, it has to enable this vast constellation of experiences and feelings. It's ridiculous. PDFs are supposed to be simple right off his my mental model that I think is shared by lot of people for how PDFs are created in used somewhere. There's a monk sitting at a castle his face illuminated by candlelight. This monk has an idea an idea that he wants to share with the world. He goes to his closet. He takes out a single Scroll of sheepskin paper. The Sheep's name was Steve. We all love Steve even though we eventually turned his skin in the paper here in the novelty sweaters. It was a complicated situation but Steve understood he was a hero there were no tears from Steve. Anyways, the month takes the skin of his friend Steve writes down his great idea.
Moog is employed by a consulting company that produces completely meaningless white papers about technology.
3D printers result in more 3D things being printed big data is bigger than you think unless you already know what the adjectives big means. There will be 27 kajillion devices by the time you finish reading this Senate basically just take the up into the right graph and label the actions whatever you want and now you can write for Forester. That's basically how that works. So anyways, this is the fact of life just the way that God intended. So the monk takes his sheepskin paper scans it he has all the content digitize a PDF is born into this world that PDF is posted on a website I downloaded and I open that PDF with the ideal PDF reader I only need for simple commands page down page up zoom out and zoom in that's all that I need for my PDF reader. So, let's see what kind of tools I get from the modern Adobe Reader Jesus Christ. Look at all that. This is what Tony e
Dark scenes when he's looking through the eyes of the Iron Man suit, right you're bombarded with all these colors and these icons and expanding menus. I mean, look at all this stuff I can do I can optimize and stamp and measure and read me that I can put Javascript in my PDF. That one's too easy. Even for me to make fun of okay. I'm just going to use that as an exercise for the reader. Right but one that does actually seem cool is that I can put accessibility features into my PDF file so that people who are blind can read the PDF using a speech synthesizer that actually seems pretty neat. So I decided to click off accessibility icon and see what happens. I'm taken to a website which tells me I have to pay money to make my PDF file accessible. That's actually kind of messed up right? So should it be ability to create accessible PDF see part of the free Adobe software? I can just imagine Wolfgang von Adobe or whatever sitting somewhere and executive office counting all the money then an angry mob of Blind Pig.
Show up at his office and they knock the desk off his lamp and the lamp off his desk and he says now you're playing in our world right now to be clear. I'm not encouraging blind people to form gangs of vandalism. Okay, in case any of you are news reporters. Don't tweet this SnapChat or whatever the kids do these days. I'm just saying that Adobe PDF reader has a ton of features that most people don't need I think and the result of that adobe constantly has to update itself to add new features and Patch the old ones. So by the way, this is a pretty uplifting talk, huh? Just a list of things that I hate. You're lucky the organizers only gave me 30 minutes. Otherwise, I'd be up here Fidel Castro style, you know our 15 T2, nanovm are a tool of capitalist oppression. The workers deserve em, three double x large from each according to their ability to each according to their poorly understood understood workload characteristics, which may not in fact need the most expensive VM right San Francisco belong to the San Francisco.
New variety who used Ginger vacation to push out the original San franciscans. Anyway, what was I talking about? Yes, so I was talking about things. I don't like it was very easy for me to recover my train of thoughts are so what don't I like well one thing I don't like is that I feel like there are too many software Frameworks these days. So back in the good old days. There was just one software framework and it was called Lipsy way back in the good old days your application consisted of things. You did yourself other things you did yourself and that was it people were hard-working and they knew the value of re implementing the wheel. Okay, there was no sharing of higher-level Frameworks if you didn't like lipsi then you go home because that's how things work around here. Our little town has everything we want. We got a restaurant. We got a package on we got a place where you can sit and we got Lipsy. Okay, that's all that we need. But now these developers these days they're so new fangled and when I hear about all this talk about Thursday,
Framework in that framework. I just want to cry big Angry tears, right? So whenever I go to Silicon Valley, I hang out in the coffee shops. I always hear the developers talking about Frameworks. One of them says hey, how's the upcoming long? The other one says? Oh, it's going pretty good. Pretty good. We just migrated from AWS to Cloud. I owe that I owe they have 17 tens of availability. They also thought of data centers located in outer space the center of the earth and the Louvre how exciting so it's pretty awesome. If I do say so myself, I store all of my application data in kitchen sink, which is a non-relational no sequel semi relational. Json document table store.
It supports all possible schema types natively. It only has indices if you wanted to and if it only has in the season everything becomes an NDC, so it's just very fast. It's like super convenient. Then of course the support continuous testing and development. I set up an instance of you to real MVP which simultaneously executes my post commit Hooks and also sends me an inspirational quote of the day from a famous movie star or an older European gentleman who lived in the 17 hundreds and I also put all my configuration data inside of Gandalf. The other person says, oh I've heard of that you mean Gandalf the Grey know getting off the white it's totally incompatible with Gandalf the Grey the data format change from XML the Json, it's just a big mess a big mess. Anyways, though. Of course, my application needs a monitoring inspection to ensure that all of my code is running properly now for that I use drunk in front of me from high school as a service.
This is actually a crowdsourcing platform that harnesses the power of all the losers that I knew from high school. These people are constantly monitoring my infrastructure in sending me irritating late night text messages about the lack of infrastructure. They also text me and they asked whether they should stay in their current relationship and then I say no but then they say but I love her so much then I'm like we should try to make it work and they say but it hurts so bad. I don't know what to tell them cuz they've been in this place. Sometimes it's not healthy anymore. You know what I'm saying? Anyways back to my infrastructure. So I collect my mobile payments using triangle and I collect my web payment using Bill buddy and I detect payment fraud using Palm know which allows me to look at my financial statements and see if any of them are being used by Pokemons associate with financial crime such as Russian mob Syndicate Pikachu and Kim Jong-un needs a concurrency Bulbasaur.
So the developer on the right finishes the description of the application stack and he says so what do you think now if this world were Fair the developer on the left would transform into some type of zombie and devour the developer on the right? Unfortunately, we do not live in this world. So we suffer what we must so I hear all these conversations at the coffee shop and I'm not really conclude that I should probably learn some more about these new technologies. So I open up my laptop and I try to do some research on the internet. However, when I use the wireless network the connection is just really bad right? It's horrible. I'm trying to open up a tutorial on YouTube. I'm not getting 1020 P. I'm not even getting 720p. I'm getting 7-piece. Okay, I don't even know this was an option. I have 3 and 1/2 pixels. Okay. One of them isn't even parallel to the Horizon. It makes no sense. This is how a salamander perceives the world salamanders can.
Not understand tutorials on large-scale web services. I feel like I'm not getting a lot from this tutorial.
So I make this sad sad noise of defeat and then I noticed that the only person in San Francisco who is older than 35 is now leaning over my shoulder. This man turns to me and I can tell that he's extremely wise and knowledgeable and and he says I noticed that you were looking for something on the web. Maybe you could find the same information at a library and I say I'm not trying to learn about the causes for the French Revolution. I need to learn about a web protocol that was invented five minutes ago. Do you see it on saying right when you take the internet away from you as a developer? I'm literally ruined as a person. Okay. It's like you Stripped Away all of my fundamental dignity. Okay. I'm getting two kilobytes per second over this wireless connection. I tried to load my Facebook page. I got something from a CSI episode. Okay, this is repairable. Okay, so my timeline my newsfeed and my friend list have all merged into something that supports neither time nor news nor friends. Okay. I can't live in a world like this month.
Okay, so can you spare me some sympathy? Can you try to understand where I'm coming from?
And the man closes book and he leans over and he says that's not really what I would came here to tell you today. And then he takes off the mask and it's a time traveling grace hop, what a convenient anecdote with which to me that I talk time travel is real Grace Hopper has access to it, and she's using it to deliver common-sense wisdom to the confused technocratic Elite. My name is James Mickens. Thank you for your time.
Using linear algebra and a shot-by-shot analysis of ‚ÄúPulp Fiction,‚Äù I prove that any distributed system will be broken 93% of the time. In the remaining 7% of the time, the system will respond to your requests, but it will hang out at skateboard parks and listen to disreputable music.
Many people say that mobile devices are the future. Apparently, the future is composed of devices that are shaped like optimally droppable objects, and whose sole purpose is to hold a charge for 17 minutes before transforming into a cellphone-sized pocket stone.
It's difficult to make transistors any smaller because nature hates us and quantum mechanics are stealing our voltage. Perhaps we should return to the abacus; sometimes, the old ways are the best ways.
Even as we speak, systems programmers are doing pointer arithmetic so that children and artists can pretend that their x86 chips do not expose an architecture designed by Sauron.
Wherein it is revealed that 1024-bit keys cannot prevent people from sending their credit card numbers to Nigerian princes. (I think that 1025-bit keys might solve the problem, but nobody listens to my common-sense advice.)
Network-accessible applications seemed like a good idea. Then somebody invented JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. THE DREAM BECAME A NIGHTMARE. Unless you like buggy, standards-hating web browsers, in which case, hey, cool dream.
Young people often come up to me and say that ‚Äúthe cloud is the future.‚Äù This is proof that young people are idiots. In this talk, I also describe why the middle aged people who built the cloud are idiots. I don‚Äôt say anything bad about old people, mainly because I love their charming stories and their delightful insistence that ATM machines were created by the Devil.
It‚Äôs been known for years that JavaScript is a dangerous, unholy language that is banned in 27 countries and most fine restaurants. In this talk, I will use deeply personal and completely biased examples to describe why I hate JavaScript. I will then provide additional reasons why the entire web stack is a thing that should not be tolerated by moral human beings. I will also describe some of my futile research efforts to make web browsers moderately less the worse thing ever.
In this bleak, relentlessly morbid talk, James Mickens will describe why making computers secure is an intrinsically impossible task. He will explain why no programming language makes it easy to write secure code. He will then discuss why cloud computing is a black hole for privacy, and only useful for people who want to fill your machine with ads, viruses, or viruses that masquerade as ads. At this point in the talk, an audience member may suggest that Bitcoins can make things better. Mickens will laugh at this audience member and then explain why trusting the Bitcoin infrastructure is like asking Dracula to become a vegan. Mickens will conclude by describing why true love is a joke and why we are all destined to die alone and tormented. The first ten attendees will get balloon animals, and/or an unconvincing explanation about why Mickens intended to (but did not) bring balloon animals. Mickens will then flee on horseback while shouting ‚ÄúThe Prince of Lies escapes again!‚Äù
It‚Äôs difficult to administer large systems. In this talk, Mickens will argue that we should just give up. Instead of asking large systems to do anything at all, we should focus on less quixotic goals like turning lead into gold, or stopping Pok√©mon from having delightfully idiosyncratic magic abilities. Using case studies involving popular systems for version control and automatic OS updates, James Mickens will gradually make himself more and more depressed, and then he will tearfully answer questions in a way that makes everybody feel awkward. Mickens will then sign copies of his book. Note that Mickens has not written a book.
"What are the best practices for shipping high-quality software?" This question is an example of a question that I will not answer in my talk. Instead, I will describe why any software project that contains more than 10 lines of code is guaranteed to fail. Using my fragmentary knowledge of the laws of thermodynamics, I will explain why code is like a proton that must ultimately turn into a crystal or, uh, whatever it is that thermodynamics says will happen. I will demonstrate how unit tests, functional programming, and UML diagrams fail to address the primary source of software failure (namely, that software is an inherently bad idea because our brains evolved to hunt giant sloths with primitive stone tools, and MongoDB only partially resembles a giant sloth). I will conclude the talk by luring a group of agile programming experts into a large cardboard box using a collection of buzzwords like "evolutionary development" and "cross-functional team;" once captured, they will be forced to implement obscene, poorly-specified COBOL algorithms as I laugh maniacally and disable my compiler warnings.
Some people enter the technology industry to build newer, more exciting kinds of technology as quickly as possible. My keynote will savage these people and will burn important professional bridges, likely forcing me to join a monastery or another penance-focused organization. In my keynote, I will explain why the proliferation of ubiquitous technology is good in the same sense that ubiquitous Venus weather would be good, i.e., not good at all. Using case studies involving machine learning and other hastily-executed figments of Silicon Valley‚Äôs imagination, I will explain why computer security (and larger notions of ethical computing) are difficult to achieve if developers insist on literally not questioning anything that they do since even brief introspection would reduce the frequency of git commits. At some point, my microphone will be cut off, possibly by hotel management, but possibly by myself, because microphones are technology and we need to reclaim the stark purity that emerges from amplifying our voices using rams‚Äô horns and sheets of papyrus rolled into cone shapes. I will explain why papyrus cones are not vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks, and then I will conclude by observing that my new start-up papyr.us is looking for talented full-stack developers who are comfortable executing computational tasks on an abacus or several nearby sticks.
In this presentation, I explain the signs that a tech idea is bad. The best indication is that the idea involves technology or is liked by someone who likes technology. After encouraging all venture capitalists to return their equity to Satan (the ultimate source of their power), I will awkwardly admit that the equity should have been cast into a black hole instead of being concentrated in the hands of a single demon lord. The audience will agree that hindsight is 20/20, and I will keep my generous severance package. There will be a lemonade break to allow any overpaid software engineers to drive up housing costs in their local neighborhoods. I will probably run out of lemonade because my ML model for predicting lemonade demand doesn‚Äôt actually encode any fundamental insights about the lemonade market. At the after-party, there will be a contest to see who can pretend to like Rust the most. Everyone will be a winner.
Whenever I go to a conference and I discover that there will be a presentation about Byzantine fault tolerance, I always feel an immediate, unshakable sense of sadness, kind of like when you realize that bad things can happen to good people, or that Keanu Reeves will almost certainly make more money than you over arbitrary time scales. Watching a presentation on Byzantine fault tolerance is similar to watching a foreign film from a depressing nation that used to be controlled by the Soviets‚Äîthe only difference is that computers and networks are constantly failing instead of young Kapruskin being unable to reunite with the girl he fell in love with while he was working in a coal mine beneath an orphanage that was atop a prison that was inside the abstract concept of World War II. ‚ÄúHow can you make a reliable computer service?‚Äù the presenter will ask in an innocent voice before continuing, ‚ÄúIt may be difficult if you can‚Äôt trust anything and the entire concept of happiness is a lie designed by unseen overlords of endless deceptive power.‚Äù The presenter never explicitly says that last part, but everybody understands what‚Äôs happening. Making distributed systems reliable is inherently impossible; we cling to Byzantine fault tolerance like Charlton Heston clings to his guns, hoping that a series of complex software protocols will somehow protect us from the oncoming storm of furious apes who have somehow learned how to wear pants and maliciously tamper with our network packets.
Every paper on Byzantine fault tolerance contains a diagram that looks like Figure 1.The caption will say something like ‚ÄúFigure 2: Our network protocol.‚Äù The caption should really say, ‚ÄúOne day, a computer wanted to issue a command to an online service. This simple dream resulted in the generation of 16 gajillion messages. An attacker may try to interfere with the reception of 1/f of these messages. Luckily, 1/f is much less than a gajillion for any reasonable value of f. Thus, at least 15 gajillion messages will survive the attacker‚Äôs interference. These messages will do things that only Cthulu understands; we are at peace with his dreadful mysteries, and we hope that you feel the same way. Note that, with careful optimization, only 14 gajillion messages are necessary. This is still too many messages; however, if the system sends fewer than 14 gajillion messages, it will be vulnerable to accusations that it only handles reasonable failure cases, and not the demented ones that previous researchers spitefully introduced in earlier papers in a desperate attempt to distinguish themselves from even more prior (yet similarly demented) work. As always, we are nailed to a cross of our own construction.‚ÄùIn a paper about Byzantine fault tolerance, the related work section will frequently say, ‚ÄúCompare the protocol diagram of our system to that of the best prior work. Our protocol is clearly better.‚Äù The paper will present two graphs that look like Figure 2.Trying to determine which one of these hateful diagrams is better is like gazing at two unfathomable seaweed bundles that washed up on the beach and trying to determine which one is marginally less alienating. Listen, regardless of which Byzantine fault tolerance protocol you pick, Twitter will still have fewer than two nines of availability. As it turns out, Ted the Poorly Paid Datacenter Operator will not send 15 cryptographically signed messages before he accidentally spills coffee on the air conditioning unit and then overwrites your tape backups with bootleg recordings of Nickelback. Ted will just do these things and then go home, because that‚Äôs what Ted does. His extensive home collection of ‚ÄúThundercats‚Äù cartoons will not watch itself. Ted is needed, and Ted will heed the call of duty. Every paper on Byzantine fault tolerance introduces a new kind of data consistency. This new type of consistency will have an ostensibly straightforward yet practically inscrutable name like ‚Äúleap year triple-writer dirty-mirror asynchronous semi-consistency.‚Äù In Section 3.2 (‚ÄúAn Intuitive Overview‚Äù), the authors will provide some plainspoken, spiritually appealing arguments about why their system prevents triple-conf licted write hazards in the presence of malicious servers and unexpected outbreaks of the bubonic plague. ‚ÄúIntuitively, a malicious server cannot lie to a client because each message is an encrypted, nested, signed, mutually-attested log entry with pointers to other encrypted and nested (but not signed) log entries.‚Äù Interestingly, these kinds of intuitive arguments are not intuitive. A successful intuitive explanation must invoke experiences that I have in real life. I have never had a real-life experience that resembled a Byzantine fault tolerant protocol. For example, suppose that I am at work, and I want to go to lunch with some of my co-workers.
I announce my desire to go to lunch. I verify that I heard that you want to go to lunch. I also verify that I heard that you want to go to lunch. YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO TO LUNCH. OH NO. LET ME TELL YOU AGAIN THAT I WANT TO GO TO LUNCH. YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO TO LUNCH. CHRIS IS FAULTY. CHRIS IS NOT FAULTY. I VERIFY THAT BRYAN SAYS THAT CHRIS IS FAULTY. I VERIFY MY VERIFICATION OF MY CLAIM THAT RICH CLAIMS THAT I KNOW CHRIS.JAMES: I AM SO HUNGRY.CHRIS: YOU ARE NOT HUNGRY.RICH: I DECLARE CHRIS TO BE FAULTY. I DECLARE RICH TO BE FAULTY. I DECLARE JAMES TO BE SLIPPING INTO A  DIABETIC  COMA. I have already left for the cafeteria.
In conclusion, I think that humanity should stop publishing papers about Byzantine fault tolerance. I do not blame my fellow researchers for trying to publish in this area, in the same limited sense that I do not blame crackheads for wanting to acquire and then consume cocaine. The desire to make systems more reliable is a powerful one; unfortunately, this addiction, if left unchecked, will inescapably lead to madness and/or tech reports that contain 167 pages of diagrams and proofs. Even if we break the will of the machines with formalism and cryptography, we will never be able to put Ted inside of an encrypted, nested log, and while the datacenter burns and we frantically call Ted‚Äôs pager, we will realize that Ted has already left for the cafeteria.
My name is James mickens and I'm here to give you a keynote speech now some of you may be unaware about what a keynote is supposed to accomplish. So here's the definition for a keynote a keynote is Faith availing tone or central theme typically one that has said are introduced at the start of a conference the central theme that I will be discussing today is computer science as in trouble. What are we doing with our lives? Get out? Okay. That's the central theme that I'll be introducing as a result after my keynote. The rest of the conference is canceled go to the aquarium. There's a Chick-fil-A nearby that was quite delicious. Just try to put together the shattered pieces of your broken life now, by the way, welcome to usenix security. It's so nice to see so many of you out there. Now. Let me tell you a completely true story that explains why I'm the right person to give this keynote. So a few weeks ago I was in San Francisco since escaping the orbit of San Francisco is the sisyphean rock that all technologists are forced to push. So I was in San Francisco at a coffee shop and I was sitting outside girl dressed in colonial Garb as one does and so I'm sitting there enjoying a book and then a magician comes up to me. Okay, so I knew that he was a magician because he said do you want to see a magic trick off? And so I said no. Thank you, sir. I'm reading a book but this magician was very very pushy. So he got right up in my face and he was like don't you believe in the power of magic? And I said, well no because the options are liars. Okay, the thing was hidden in your hand or in your sleeve you had a mirror there were two people you didn't tell anybody in half. So just leave me in peace Wizard. And by the way that last phrase leave me in peace wizard hasn't been said since the 14th century. So anyway, so this magician want to go away and the other people in the coffee shop are looking at me with this expression that says, I'm sorry that you're dealing with this Abr
So I tell this magician listen just go away and then he says if you can tell me how I do this next trick. I'm going to leave you alone. So I said okay fine fine. Let me see the trick. So we did this thing that probably many of you have seen them and showed me that he was holding one ping pong ball in his hand and then he moved his hands around then he was holding to ping pong balls and then he moved his hands around again. And then he was just holding one. And so he did the whole trick in the office. I mean, he said how to do that mortal now, he didn't explicitly say the moral part but like I know that it was there. So I told him dude I understand how this works. Okay, you have a single ping pong ball you cut in half and so when you show, you know, the fronts of the two has it looks like you have to ping pong balls, but really you move it around a little bit of sleight-of-hand. You connect them in your hand then it's like, oh you made one ping pong ball disappear off really just putting the two halves together. And so it was great because when I explain this trick to him the magician made that weird sound that magicians make when they're defeated he was like and then home
Walked away and it was so fulfilling and as he left everyone in the coffee shop was like go home magician, but I was different because I said begone magician because that's the grammatically correct way to chase a wizard out of your neighborhood. Okay. So why did I tell you that story at first glance? It might seem like it's just a light-hearted tale of wizard heckling but really what that story is about is about the value of skepticism, right? So I feel like computer scientists sort of as a whole we've forgotten some of the value of skepticism. And as a result, I feel like we're leading ourselves a stray. I feel like technology in general and computer science in particular have been hyped up to such an extreme level that we've ignored the importance not only issue of security but broader Notions of ethical Computing. So for example, have you heard about this little technology called machine learning anyone in the crowd? Well, of course you have because machine learning is like a game.

Inverse Fight Club, the first rule of machine learning Fight Club is that you must talk about Fight Club. The second rule is that let's not fight because we all just agree that m l is just so fantastic. So everybody wants to have machine learning now, we can use machine learning to analyze marketing data to build customer profiles to actually form romantic connection with other people who believe in the power of machine learning machine learning according to IBM. You can use the cognitive power of Watson to drive deeper consumer engagement new experiences and augment the management of Regulatory Compliance. That sentence is so buzzworthy. It's almost not English if we were just to add the word doubleplusgood here may have now written a sequel to the book 1984 machine learning.
It is oxygen that we all breathe or at least the oxygen that Silicon Valley is trying to force into our lungs now. Unfortunately, I'm going to argue that the increasing use of them is actually problematic from the security perspective. So what do I mean by that? Well at a high level I think that the goal of computer security is to ensure that systems do the right thing even in the presence of malicious inputs. Now achieving this goal in the context of machine learning is exceptionally challenging for two reasons. So first of all, computer scientists lack a deep mathematical understanding of how machine learning actually learns and predicts and I'll go into this a little more detail later and second many people who deploy machine learning don't actually care about the first problem. So as a result these people make a series of terrible life decisions many of which involve connecting machine learning to the internet now everyone in this room knows that the internet.
Trouble. Okay. The internet is not some kind of summer camp for Amish you okay? Here's what the internet is hacker chat rooms pictures of blobfish and worse Okay computer viruses with names like pirate Photoshop. Exe. Okay, it's very tempting to click on that. Okay, so don't do that. I heard that from a friend. Anyways, the point is that the Internet is just this call Jaron of evil, but if you know that the internet is a cauldron of evil and if you know that you don't fully understand how machine learning works. Why would you connect the two what would convince me that this is a good idea this can't possibly make things better. So to explain why this is I'm actually going to examine a machine learning and a bit more depth will take 2 minutes and just have a very quick overview of what I like to call the problem with math. So the problem with this is that like I said, a lot of people don't really understand a lot of the the math that underlies machine learning. So for example, let's consider gradient.
Let's suppose that we want to build a classifier to identify handwritten digits. So the input of that classifier will be a vector that represents the pixels and an image. So for example, imagine that we had this four by four grid of pixels here and we need to draw a gray-scale image. So we just paints a little pixels there. Just put them where we think they should go just there's no such thing as a mistake and voila now, we have some pixels now we can represent each one of those pixels as a numeric value which indicates how dark the pixel is. Okay, and then we can actually flatten that song by four grid into an array this array is going to be the thing that's going to be the input to the classifier.
So now we know how to generate the input to this classifier the output for the classifier will be a vector of 10 probabilities with each entry representing the likelihood that an image represents a particular number. So for example, given that image that we just painted a classifier might spit out probabilities like the following so like in this example, the class of fire has 92% confidence that the digits of form now, of course, we need some way to train our model now for that we can use the training set which is just input data that's already been labeled with the appropriate classifications wage. Now some of you may know the most popular testing data four-digit recognition is this thing called The Mist data set, which was created. When three explorers named Ian Carina and Christopher went to a haunted house in labeled a bunch of devil numbers from an ancient book of evil. So according to Ian this image represents a five now according to Common Sense this image represents the faith.
Sigil of I'm on Google the most detestable of the undying one's not saying that machine learning is the portal to a Demon Universe. I'm just saying that some doors are best left unopened regardless back to our classifier. So the classifier is going to take a vector of pixels in his input in the classifiers going to Output a vector of probabilities representing the likelihood of them represents the digit 0 or 1 or so on and so forth. So to build this type of output Vector, we could feed the input to in neural-net, which is basically just a network of functions that come off on the input data in various ways.
So if we look at a single neuron, then what we'll see is the neuron takes in a set of input numbers and outputs a linear combination of the inputs that output is modulated by some function f and that function f is often chosen to be a nonlinear function. So for example, ask might be the hyperbolic tangent function which takes a real number in his input and then Maps it to this sort of squished range -1 to 1. So the purpose of introducing that nonlinear function is that it allows the neural net to actually learn non-linear relationships between the input data and output of data in this ability is important because in real life classifications often times and nonlinear task so great. That's what in Iran looks like but how are we going to pick the waits for the neural net? Well, this is what training is going to do. Okay, so during training we try to find the assignment of Weights that minimizes the classification error of the neural net. I know some of this math might seem a little bit tedious, but I've got to build things up before I can't are dead.
Down so roughly speaking. The purpose of the training is that we want to find out the assignment of Weights that minimizes the differences between the classifications of the neural in the classifications of some Oracle. So for example, if we have a classifier that only has two weights, we can depict all the possible weight assignments in an XY plane for Chicago assignment of Weights. We can then use the Z access to show the classification error that the neural net produces for that particular assignment of Weights. The error then is going to be the difference. Like I said what the classification of the neural net outputs and what the classification of the Oracle would be. So how do we minimize that error? Well, if we look at the Contour graph for the classification error may want to know the weight that are down at the bottom in the valley where classification error is lowest. However, we lack a priori knowledge of what that Contour looks like. So we do this thing called gradient descent dead.
Roughly speaking. We pick a random assignment of weights. And then we look around in our neighborhood and the Contour graph to see what direction the error is going to decrease the fastest.
So we're going to take a little step in that direction. Then we get there. We're going to look around again. We're going to check those local gradients. And once again, we're going to step in the direction that the error seems to go down the quickest and soul will keep doing this will keep doing this and we're going to get to that Valley. Okay. So if you've understood the discussion so far congratulations with your basic knowledge of gradient descent, you've achieved Third Eye Activation drop out of college and form a startup.
Peter Thiel citizen of New Zealand be so proud of you. Don't forget young people. There's still time to apply for the Peter Thiel encourages you to drop out of college startup Fellowship Church education is overrated and if your startup fails don't worry because Peters deal is still Rich. So the story has a happy ending Fellowship.
So all of you young people looking for job opportunities Okay. This may you might have hit the jackpot anyways, so let's get back to the machine learning part. So if you think about the machine learning process that I just described life, you'll realize that the process is actually quite subtle. So for example, what's the best step function to use inside of each neuron when we do gradient descent. What should the size of The Descent stage that be how many layers should we use and how big should each of these layers be now the answers to these questions actually have a big impact on how the machine learning algorithm works. Right? So for example, if the size of The Descent step is too small then training will need a long time to converge the optimal. However, if the size of that step is to Big then what may end up happening is may end up overshooting the optimal weight assignment and you know, once again sort of taking a long time to converge, so how do we tune these so-called hyperparameters how we answer these kinds of questions well, the exciting answer that I'm really happy to be able to break today is that nobody really knows the answers to these questions because machine learning is a c s equivalent of the egg drop experiment America's favorite physics chemistry from eighth grade. So in the egg drop, if you remember your goal is to drop a container that has an egg in it. So you can drop the egg from 20 feet in the egg doesn't break. So the most popular strategy for solving the egg drop is just do some stuff just go crazy like a wild animal just explore that studio space. Okay. And so if you do something and then the egg, then it breaks and the stuff worked and if somebody asked you why the stuff worked you just say the stuff is what the stuff is brother except the mystery. Okay, and so basically machine learning is like this off, right? So we've invented invented a bunch of techniques that kind of work like in some cases, but we're not really sure what's going on.
So for example, like a recent paper by a lukic actually examined several machine learning approaches that were thought to have some fairly fundamental differences in prediction accuracy. And so what the paper shows that actually if you carefully tuned those hyperparameters, then you can actually reduce the performance gaps between these algorithms that seemed like kind of very different on their face. And so that's actually interesting and slightly disturbing. And so if you want more sort of low-level technical details on this topic, I encourage you to read a paper called the Winner's curse by Scully at all. You should also listen to Raheem he's acceptance page for the test of time Award of the nips 2017 conference all of these sources provide some really great technical information about the current confusion in the community about how machine learning works and get this by the way is related to the other better known problem with machine learning. Mainly that machine learning is not interpretable, right? We have no good way to explain why these models generate the outputs that they dead.
So for example, here's the high-level view of Google's Inception neural net for image classification. And you might look at that and you might think to yourself. Well, how does this stuff in here affect the classification process? Like if we look at the weights in these layers, like what do the weights tell us about the way that the model the stuff is what the stuff is brother? Okay. We don't ask questions about the weights. We just wake up we go to work we use the weights we go back home. Okay, if we change the waves the predictions would be different and less good. Probably depending on the weather so we don't ask about the weights. Okay. So what have we as humans learned about this? Well, okay. So fine we've learned that machine learning is inscrutable. That's okay, but why I'm not getting screwed ability a problem to be fair and screwed ability is not a problem in and of itself the problems arise when you take something that's inscrutable and you make two mistakes.
The first mistake is that you connect that inscrutable thing too important real life things like financial markets or criminal justice system's the second mistake is that you connect the inscrutable thing to the internet of hate which is oftentimes simply abbreviated as the internet.
We live in a world where these two mistakes happen every day. And this is incredibly frustrating to watch like where else in life. Would you see someone connect a giant mystery to Mystical systems. So to make this more concrete, here's an example. This guy up here is Kingsley. Okay. So Kingsley is the mascot for the Patrick missile football team in Scotland Kingsley much like machine learning is inscrutable. He raises more questions than answers. Here's Kingsley losing a foot race against two dogs and a viking. Here's King Kong holding Valentine's Day flowers in a desperate attempt to discover a female of the species. Here's Kingsley sitting on pieces of furniture, which are clearly large enough off multiple people and yet Kingsley does not get out of the way to allow those people to sit down Kingsley, obviously a jerk, but at a deeper level he is a mystery and yet that's okay. Yep.
Okay, because nobody asked Kingsley for his opinion about important things now make no mistake Kingsley dreams of the world that lives beyond his own eyes. He thinks about being a mayor using those big scissors. They have in the ribbon-cutting ceremonies. He thinks about being a CEO and giving vibrant PowerPoint presentations to investors when Kingsley closes his eyes. He sees judge Kingsley renowned for his wisdom and his Insight unfortunately for Kingsley, but fortunately for the rest of society Kingsley will spend the majority of his time locked up in a supermax prison cut off from the levers of power that he so desperately wants Kingsley will only be allowed in the soccer field between the hours of 6 p.m. And 10 p.m. And he would not have a red sniper. Following him at all times.
Society does not trust Kingsley because Kingsley is strange. We have no idea how Kingsley thanks. And so we have no guarantee that Kingsley will operate Thursday best interests us. We don't allow Kingsley to make important decisions for society. Now, let's contrast how we treat Kingsley with how we treat machine learning another inscrutable phenomenom. So did you know that is being used to perform risk assessments of criminal defendants to decide things like bond amounts or whether somebody gets paroles that a jail did you know the machine life is being used to determine whether people qualify for loans or mortgages. Did you know that people are using AI to screen job applicants and to match buyers and sellers inequities off. And of course is everyone in this room knows is also being used to detect anomalies in cyber security settings. So here's the question. Would you want Kingsley doing these things?
If the answer is no then perhaps you should have second thoughts about getting a i to do those types of things. So I'm going to argue that mission creep is extremely problematic off. Right as I discussed earlier is problematic because we don't really understand how these algorithms learn and how biased might have crept into the training data and how machine learning algorithms might behave when subjected to Target it a text. Now you might be wondering what's a concrete example of these types of problems. Well, did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth take the bigoted? It's not a story the AI Fanboys would tell you so today is a great example of how well-intentioned technologists are likely going to destroy the world. So today was intended to be a virtual conversational partner the intended workflow looked like this in step one. He started a conversation by sending a tweet to Thursday.
In step to pay received the Tweet analyzes it using machine-learning and then responds in the style of a nineteen-year-old girl. So step three keep on talking to take it's great. She's a girl and she never sleeps just like Samara from The Ring but let's not skip ahead in the story though pretend you didn't see that. So that's how they worked. The tail was a job and that sounds great because people want to talk indeed if we think about it conversation is a key aspect of our Humanity conversation is what separates us from the house plant from the salt shaker from the inflatable Tube Man Who implores us come get a great deal on a car or a mattress.
These things can't talk to us and so we can't rely on them to provide that sense of Solace. We need to express our feelings to something that can understand our words. So people want to express themselves and we as technologists should be trying to make it easier for people to have authentic conversations with each other. So, how should we address that problem? Well, here's the pool of socially well-connected people talking to each other and here's the pool on the right of lonely people who basically talked to no one so one could try to build new network edges that connect the lonely wage people to the non lonely people so that both sets of people can expand their social network and share their Rich set of deeply personal experiences with each other. So, yeah, we could do that but clears a better solution is to direct all of that lonely energy to synthetic personalities running on data center events, so that the people who are happy can just continue to be happy while the people off
Who are lonely can shout into availability zones on the west coast of Northern Europe This is clearly the humanist solution. I feel like in so many ways not creating real interpersonal connections is a perfectly valid way to solve social problems. For example, are you frustrated at work? Well, you can share your problems with the friend or you can drink alone and pretend that took the king of Spain right problem solved. Don't let anyone ever tell you you're not the king of Spain I digress of course. So here's what happened with Tay. So today had this really interesting feature. So when you send a tweet to Tay Tay what update her conversational model using the content in your Tweet, so this is why Microsoft described. Hey like this the more you chat with Tay this morning. She gets now on first glance. This seems like a totally reasonable way to teach a machine learning algorithm how to converse using natural language.
So real people all across the world would open up their hearts release the hidden sonnets the unspoken novels that song that lives in each one of us when we laugh cry and people would send this beauty this Humanity to take and then Tay would emerge glorious and wise to Usher us into a golden age of conversation understanding and we would look at our creation and we would be proud because our glorious AI child had learned dignity and decency from crowd-sourced wheat way. What was that? We're going to teach a machine learning algorithm about decency and dignity by feeding. It tweets from random internet people news flash internet. People are the worst people. They are the absolute worst people. Have you ever been to fortune or Yahoo! Answers job.

These are not the kind of people who should be running a daycare center for a eye on Yahoo! Answers people. Ask questions like this how much Listerine does it take to get drunk?
Do midgets have night vision?
Why do we need Rockets if planes can just fly to the moon? And here's a summary of most of the discussions on Fortune question? Why is society getting worse everyday? Let's click on this post and see what the reasons are. Well, oh women blacks gays Hispanics unfair media coverage of the video game industry. What an insightful piece of commentary for sham. So awesome. So this is what the internet is. So why don't we take what that is and then just use it to train a chatbot what could go wrong? I've got a really good feeling about this. So take him back online. And at first taste as these very lovely things. So for example, Taylor responded to one Twitter user like this. Can I just say that I'm stoked to meet you humor or super cool. Well, that's that's really nice in a little while later tasted the following. Here's a question humans. Why isn't every day National puppy day, right?
That's really heartwarming. But then things went sour why is that well, it's because of the internet people see because the internet people discovered that by sending racist and sexist tweets to Tay Tay would use that content to update her conversational model.
So within a few hours take entered a very dark place, so for example, somebody asked a what race is the most evil to you and Taylor responded well Mexican and black remarkably specific another person asked a whether we should start the race War Two which they responded Yes sure am already starting and what I love about this is at the end. Hey added an emoji of a smiling person wearing sunglasses cuz it's important to be fashionable even during a race war with somebody told day. You know, you're so racist and tear responded your to Brown which somehow managed to be racist while embedding to grammatical mistakes in the span of three words, which must be some type of record. Apparently there were no grammar lessons at Odin school for Aryan you
Anyways, take continue to share her opinions about various and Sundry topics. So for example feminists Lil Tay does not like them at all. Not one bit. Well, how about the Jews? Well today actually like the Jews kidding, of course, they did not like the Jews at all. And so I'm looking at all of this and I grew up in the South. Okay, and so I'm here this is like machine learning can be Prejudiced and I thought to myself these Yankees are innovating and Prejudiced scientists. I mean, we don't have this kind of stuff back in Georgia. I mean, I feel like the south is losing the arms race and Prejudice. I mean to be clear we're still on the same. Like I feel like the Gap is shrinking. So anywho, so take kept on ranting for about 16 hours before Microsoft announced the following month. We became aware of a coordinated effort by some users to abuse taste commenting skills to have to respond in inappropriate ways. So as a result we've taken tail flying and we are met
Adjustments and So Tay roughly speaking was exiled from the internet and was never seen again except for an occasional opinion column on breitbart.com. That was actually the top article last Thursday. That's also true story. So anyways, so let's take a step back. So why am I talking about inscrutable Ai and Twitter meltdowns and using security. Well, I think that as a community we need to step back and have a more holistic view of security. So a few minutes ago I said that the goal of computer security is to ensure that our systems do the right thing even in the presence of malicious input now historically speaking do the right thing has been defined by our community in this very narrow, very technical way and this narrow hyper technical definition a rose for historical reasons and worked well because until fairly recently computers were not ubiquitous and they weren't very powerful. So back in the old days.
Computers will only possessed by militaries and governments and big corporations. So in these types of scenarios, it kind of made sense to Define Security in terms of this Cartesian product. So roughly speaking. We just needed to enumerate the people the programs and the computational resources in the system and then we can figure out which parts of that Cartesian space were good and which were bad and so this seemed to work out very well. So for example, Peter is from the Soviet Union the Soviets are bad. This is the arpanet the arpanet is good. So therefore killer must not be able to access the RF net via the login demon. So that seems pretty reasonable but in the modern world computers are much more pervasive and they're actually much more powerful and so in the modern world what you see is the technology influences countless aspects of modern life in some of those influences are obvious, but some of them are actually quite subtle and so I think that as a community we need to think about is it time for us to, New Jersey
Redefining what we think of as security to step away a little bit from that narrow Cartesian framing.
So I think that at this point we can say is a community that it's no longer sufficient to narrowly frame security as handsome actor perform some action. So now we have to start reasoning about these broader more nebulous questions, like from the moral perspective should a particular action be possible. And if so, how should that action be implemented to achieve societally beneficial outcomes now don't get me wrong the computer science Community has gotten a lot of mileage out of that Cartesian approach. So for example, let's think about return oriented programming return oriented programming is the kind of attack that Cartesian approaches are well suited for understanding so control photographs are pretty easy to express using simple Primitives, like basic blocks and branching patterns further down the attackers goal can be defined using purely mechanistic terms with respect to violations of a programs intended control flow graph.
In enumerating the attackers input vectors is relatively straightforward as well. So things like file data and network data. So on and so forth and this is all great and to be clear. I personally am not afraid to say I love returning the programming. I love the attacks. I love the defenses because what they proved is that gadgets are Eternal there will always be gadgets there were daddies before we got here. They'll be gadgets after dead when I go to using security and I see a paper title like jitt meow extracting Rob change from Impact and coded cat videos. I give myself a high-five then I plant a tree off I burn a different tree down because that's life money that's life on the streets. Okay. And in fact, I no longer use the term processes to describe the applications that I run instead. I call them homelands because the processes have always belong to the gadgets. The gadgets are the true people of the Earth. So I tell you all this to establish my credentials as one of you dead.
Like that Cartesian way of thinking and there are scenarios in which it's actually quite useful but I think that we actually need to maybe change the way that we think and why is that well as took turns out the liberal arts people are getting upset. Okay, they're very worried that computer scientists are so fixated on this narrow mechanistic way of thinking that song Losing track of the bigger picture of how technology is influencing society as large see might be thinking. Well, what do I James mickens? Think about this critique? Well now we have reached home of the keynote entitled real talk and music security. So this part of the keynote is only for computer scientists. So all the liberal arts people just leave go watch your favorite Hamilton, whatever it is that you do. Okay, we're going to talk computer scientist now. Okay, save all left great just us. So here's the thing the liberal arts people. They've made a mistake.
Fifty Shades of Grey most kinds of drum circles the name Jayden
costumes for guinea pigs that would obviously hurt the animals competitiveness in the wild. I mean these were not the best ideas but the liberal arts people they are right about something they have correctly observed the tech industry has become detached from the ramifications of the things that have built the situation with Tay I went through that because it's pretty easy to relate to even though it was horrible along in a certain way like nobody ultimately, you know, lost power, you know went to jail because of today. However, do you remember how I said that machine learning is being used for risk assessment and justice system. Well studies of risk assessment in this scenario have found that black defendants are actually incorrectly labeled as high-risk at twice the rate of white defendants what this means is that in some cases machine learning is likely sending people to jail who should not be going to jail.
And don't forget that it's actually code that's doing that. Right somebody sat down and write code to do this kind of thing. So as a community, we need to start thinking seriously about how bias is creeping into our algorithms. So let me give you another example, did you know that popular algorithms for gender detection and faces these algorithms actually can guess the gender of white men with an error rate of 1% but they have an error rate of 20 to 35% for darker skin women write these results that I'm showing up here actually came from facial recognition systems that were developed in Europe and America, however, and probably unsurprising long if you look at gender recognition systems that are developed in Asia, they actually do worse on white faces, right and I'm in saying this white people have faces to okay. I've been saying that for a long time James make is refreshing 20/20 that message is going to resonate in the Heartland. You just wait people laugh now, okay when I'm in the Oval Office or not, you'll be knocking on my door. So anyways, the larger point is that I feel like computers song.
Is we're living in a bit of a state of decadence because I think we've been blinded by the fact that politicians and Wall Street and the VCS have declared that technology is the one true path. Well, the one that passed the what what does it matter? We'll figure it out as we go along but that's not a great way of thinking. I mean, you never hear a politician visit in elementary school and say what this country means is more Dead Poets like Robert Frost like that never happens instead. The politician will say, well, you know what this country needs is more stem Majors. Why is that so we can build more flashlight apps look at any flashlight apps are already are there are many many pages of flashlight apps. Okay, and look at this. This is a real flashlight app that I found yesterday. It wants full network access the ability to read my phone's identity and also wants to receive text messages is this app going to perform some type of investigative journalism when I turn on my flashlight, it's like Uncle Edward dead.
Is actually her father said to Flashlight app. It doesn't make any sense.
And so I think that when the app store has $19 billion flashlight apps, maybe that's a sign. I don't know. Maybe it's a it's a time for reflection. And so I'm going to propose that we need to question this Manifest Destiny 2 which we are being pushed. Now anyone who's played Oregon Trail knows that Manifest Destiny oftentimes ends and dysentery. So it behooves us to think about these issues right now, because as Robert Frost once said ain't nobody got time for dysentery, okay now he didn't actually say that but some of you didn't know that cuz you didn't take a liberal arts classes. I looked into your eyes off you thought that was real. You're looking it up on Amazon shame on you. So let's take a closer. Look at what I call the assumptions of technological Manifest Destiny. So this is a religion which is the most popular on the coast of America and it's based on Three core assumptions. So the first assumption is that technology is value in neutral and will therefore automatically lead to good job.
Outcomes for everyone. I mean everything about that sentence is wrong. Just everything everything should be in scare quotes. There should be a gesture in the background spiders and meteors coming down. It's just it was painful for me to even type that way. We'll get back to more details about this in the second. So for now just know that the first Assumption of technological Manifest Destiny is that technology is value neutral and will therefore automatically lead to break out comes for everyone. Now the second assumption follows from the first one and it states that new kinds of Technology should be deployed as quickly as possible. Even if we lack a general idea of how the technology works or what the societal impact will be because after all if we delay the rollout of new technology, then we would delay the distribution of the inevitably great impact for everyone. So who would want to do that? That's a buzzkill and thus the technology must be deployed. So that's the second assumption the third assumption.
Is that history is generally uninteresting because the past has nothing to teach us right. Now this of course is a very convenient way for a technologist to think because if we look at even the very fact recent past will see that the past is strewn with disasters. Okay, nothing. It's just terrible every day is a nightmare as recently as nineteen seventy two most buildings collapsed and Rusty Nails were found in cereal boxes all the time. Okay. So when your face is his looks like this it's very difficult to be optimistic. So hey, why not think about the statistics? Why not? Just put that out of your mind. So fine in summary. Those are what I call the core tenets of technological Manifest Destiny and we've already seen how these types of ideas can lead us arise in the context of artificial intelligence. But you know, for example, let's see how these principles apply in the context of the criminal justice system. So at first glance what could be a more fair than to have a value-neutral a log?
To make sentencing decisions humans are biased but data is not so we've been told right so it seems like if we could automatically identify the truly bad criminals then society as a whole will benefit package that's principal one.
We clearly want to reduce crime as quickly as possible. So why don't we push out this software as soon as we can without taking the time to think about how bias might be creeping into those algorithms case that spring and don't forget that as technologists. We forget that the History Channel exists. So we have no historical examples to suggest that statistical Frameworks might actually lead us astray. Now that's principal three. Now. What's so interesting is that you know, in this context you can see that every one of these principles is hilariously bad. So for example, take principal 3, which would have us believe that statistical models have never led us astray. Have you ever heard of nutrition research? Hello. It's getting the carousel here saturated fat was bad before was maybe neutral and then salt used to be bad unless it's like maybe okay and then like sugar was okay, but that's very very bad like unlike or maybe it's not too bad. Look, here's the only two things. I know about nutrition. You're gonna die trying to get diabetes on the way out. Okay.
So the history of nutrition research is actually quite instructive for us as computer scientists because the history of nutrition research actually shows us off the problems and emerge when we don't think about you know, what models were using and how those models are consuming particular data sets. So I think that's why it's particularly unfortunate that a lot of technologists seem to think like, oh well, as long as I get a large enough quantity of data, that should probably be sufficient because like strengthen numbers and it's like that isn't at all how numbers work. It's not how life works like you got to know your history. So up to this point. I've been talking about these pitfalls of technological Manifest Destiny in the context of machine learning mostly but now let's pivot to dispatch The Internet of Things. This is going to be a very short discussion because I O T is not interesting. It is just not I will literally fight anyone who says otherwise, okay. Here's a one-sentence suck.
Of iot security, let's forget all the lessons from traditional network security and hope for the best know it's like these people have been living under a rock entire lives. I read a paper yesterday was described how consumer medical devices often send Aid in clear text format. Now you might think is this a history paper that was talking about ancient medical choices like birthing chairs and bloodletting tools. Nope. This was actually a paper about recent device has made this year like Wireless blood pressure monitors that generate unexpected traffic. Let me ask you this question what kind of clown in this day and age doesn't understand that TLS is the only good thing that we have. Okay, like penicillin is failing to kill bacteria, but at least we still have TLS. Okay. So like only a clown wouldn't use TLS. This is like stuff. You've got to talk about on a first date like literally dead.
It's like oh so what do you think about TLS?
I don't use it all the time.
We're not meant to be together because I'm not a clown of file. I don't associate with or communicate with clowns. It just can't happen. Right so I know that I get this constant retort from the young people I say, oh, well at least iot devices are cheap. You have to pay more to get to your less support. I mean, that's correct. But like would you have that same type of fixation on cheapness if we were talking about organ transplants, for example, so let's say you play too much OverWatch and then your hands just fall off. Okay. So you go talk to your doctor about getting a hand transplant. Would you say just push the cheapest hands possible. I just need the minimal hand functionality. If you said that then people would make fun of you when you went to parties because if you only worried about price then you're going to get potato long as those are the kind of hands that a pirate would have in the 17th century because that's your life because you only care about price. Okay, and by the way, if we give that potato in a $2 campaign,
A Wi-Fi dongle and a telnet server whose root password is 1 2 3 that iot devices a best seller the bestseller.
And people would put that device in their businesses in their places of worship in the rooms where their children sleep. Nobody would ask any questions, testimonials like the following. I just like the comfort of a potato hand constantly watching my loved ones and streaming the video to any remote party who can guess a number that's bigger than ones you to let's make more than one two for that security scheme just seems Rock Solid for me, right? I mean, so it's completely obvious why iot security is so bad. So I think like as a Community Choice time for us to agree. Let's just not talk about iot ever again. Like just we just need to sign a pledge for the children. It's just so bad. I mean to be clear in the in the spirit of honesty. I have made some mistakes in the iot space. So question have I written a paper about iot security answer. Yes. So question. What was the conclusion that paper answer iot security is not interesting now, I mean you
I'd say that to be clear the paper didn't phrase it like that because your paper will get rejected if it sounds like it was written by someone who struggles with depression, but if I had my way I wouldn't have written the paper at all. What I would have done is reduce is a I would have released a gangster rap album called bleep. This iot bleed. This sleep is bleed now. Luckily. I'm surrounded by friends and lawyers who prevents me from doing this right? But in the paper that we did right as it turns out the techniques that we describe the protect iot devices. They're very similar in many cases the equivalent to the best practices for securing a traditional network servers. So for example suppose, you've got some lightweight devices that don't run any software or can only run very simple software Well Place those devices behind an access point which has a denied by default firewall to prevent Outsiders from probing those sensitive devices.
You can use Network virtual functions on the AP to run intrusion detection software. The AP can also run TLS proxies that transparently encrypt the cleartext device traffic and if you're iot down payment has heavyweight devices with more computational resources. Well, you can force those devices to remotely attached to the AP to get network access. I mean the reason that you should do all this is like, of course you should do this. Like why wouldn't you do this? There's so many books in the security section of Barnes & Noble section that are not being read. I feel people don't want to do this kind of stuff. So I feel like it's it's really frustrating to watch the poor state of iot security because it's just so obvious to fix this stuff in these devices are typically not do anything too complicated now would be one thing. Of course if these iot devices were in available at the edge of human intellect if it were like hey, look at this iot dog bowl that's powered by cold fusion and Fermat's Last year, but like of course I O T dog bowls don't look like this. They look like potato chips.
Films that have a second attached potato to hold water. So like if you don't use fire walls and stuff like that you potatoes are going to get compromised don't be shocked. So like when I hear about iot compromises, I feel like I'm reading a very sad book that's called avoidable mistakes that happen to you yesterday told from your perspective by you right? I don't want to be in that book club. Okay not have that type of negative energy coming into my life. Now. Let me say that I O T exhibits all of those expected problems that emerge from this Cult of technological Manifest Destiny, right? So in this talk, I've mainly focused on that third assumption that history is an interesting and helpful, but I'd be glad to talk about assumptions one and two in the context of Ajo team after the talk.
So in conclusion today, I've argued for the value of skepticism if I had to summarize my advice in three words. Those words would be thankful for deploying if I had to Summer my advice into words those words to be think first if I had to summarize my advice in one word. I just say Don't just don't like whenever it was you were going to do just don't do it statistically speaking. It's not going to work out. Okay now once you get some more time, you can think about doing something, but if you're pressed for time, just don't if you feel that Rising instinct to do something just running a human-sized hamster wheel until the don't becomes apparent and then you get real sleepy gets much easier after that and if you don't feel like running I might have just the bulb in the motivates you so thank you very much. Thank you for your time off.
The meeting using the Google Google Google Google Google Google Google Google Google Google Google Google off.
Thank you so much for the talk. We have time for a few handful of questions, maybe one or two. Does anyone want to come up to the mike?
Very good. Okay. Hey Connie from William Berry. Great Target was hilarious. We are still recovering. So that was the goal to make my question is I say you have a situation where you have a problem where you need to predict something you need to protect security policies in a particular context a Enterprise security and you have a lot of data at hand. So what do you use machine learning would you not and if you would not use machine learning what else would you use that context right vast arrays of unpaid teenagers thoroughly. You should otherwise he breaking car windows. So I think that machine learning is not sort of like an unmitigated bad, but I think that like in the same way for example, like it's always shocking to me I go out to some of these startups in the Bay Area and not talk to people and I'll say like Okay cool. So, you know interesting startup and like it's it's never interesting but I just say that just to make the pain go away and then I say oh, so what's your testing strategy and they're like, you know, we just got some free dog.
Scripps laying around stuff like that and like but you just you just why isn't testing part of your methodology, right? And so I think that like when you look at things like machine learning people were actually starting to develop methodologies that you can use for example to you know, check your algorithms for biased input data to look for scuse. And it before you even feed it to the machine learning item. So on and so forth. So I think the machine learning definitely has a place, you know in society because clearly rajendra a certain data shoes that are too big to be, you know, feasibly analyzed by people, but I think it's more issue best practices, right? I think there's so much pressure to get things to market for some definition of market and I think that people just aren't showing forethought right in the same way that you know, at least in like let's say the bigger companies they will show some for thought about, you know, best testing practices various, uh, paradigms are doing testing and stuff like that. So I think that's really what I wanted to agitate for today because I feel like you know like that slide I showed up with the politicians right? I feel like you just hear all the time. Just go computer.
Signs you guys are the best. It's just amazing and from the inside, you know, I see like all these mistakes that were making that we don't have to be making and so that's really the thing that I'm trying to advocate for life. Thank you.
Thank you so much. It's now time for a break.
Yes, I am the Viceroy in question. Yes, it is difficult to become a Galactic Viceroy. No, I cannot make you a Galactic Viceroy too. Yes, it is technically within my powers to do so. But no, I will not do it, because I could give you a fish, or I could teach you how to fish, or I could just drop the mic and then ride away in my custom-built hovercraft, as Galactic Viceroys are wont to do.
I‚Äôm glad to hear that you enjoyed the articles! I‚Äôd like to write some more; hopefully I can do so in the second half of the year. The main impediment is finding the spare time. Each article takes about 10‚Äî20 hours to write; I have not found a wealthy aristocrat who will pay me to generate lengthy diatribes about computer science, so I have to fit the writing around my day job of being a researcher. If you, or someone you know, is a wealthy aristocrat, COME TALK TO ME.
I wish that there was a platonic dating site that matched writers with rich aristocrats looking to fund the production of extended jeremiads about Byzantine fault tolerance. Venture capitalists should be interested in this idea. It‚Äôs no dumber than the other things that they fund.
My main piece of advice is that if you‚Äôre trying to give a humorous talk, you have to continually thread humor into your presentation. You can‚Äôt just add three jokes and then expect that people will say ‚ÄúThat was a funny talk!‚Äù afterwards. In general, any piece of communication (verbal or written, funny or not-funny) should have a small number of narrative themes; every part of the communication must reinforce those themes.
With respect to picking a particular style of humor for a talk, you have to do what feels natural. What kind of stuff do you find funny in real life? What comedians or movies or TV shows make you laugh? Study those performances, and think explicitly about why they succeed or fail. Then, apply that same type of analysis to your own stuff. When you give a practice talk, see what resonates with people and what doesn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt be afraid to throw stuff away that isn‚Äôt working!
With respect to humor in computer science (or science in general), I actually think that there are a lot of opportunities to find comedy! My attitude in life is that, unless you‚Äôre directly helping to end war, poverty, and homelessness at the same time, you don‚Äôt have the right to be ultra-serious. I think that if scientists reflect on their day-to-day routines, they‚Äôll find a lot of funny moments. The tricky part is expressing that humor to people who may not share your exact day-to-day routine. That‚Äôs why I think that it‚Äôs so important to observe people who do this well, and think explicitly about how their delivery creates humor. Also, as mentioned above, you have to practice the art of comedy in particular, and storytelling in general! Or make a pact with Satan to give you unholy powers. Hint: DO NOT MAKE A PACT WITH SATAN.
On the topic of being funny as a black person (or, more broadly, an underrepresented person), the trickiest part is that being funny is the process of making people accept your narrative, and, as someone from an underrepresented group, you may have to work harder to get credibility. There‚Äôs no easy way to get around this challenge. You have to practice your story-telling skills, and learn how to read body language and tone so that you can establish a good connection with your audience.
Try not to beat yourself up. Who hasn‚Äôt made an ill-advised pact with Satan and then been forced to deal with the consequences? This is why my office occasionally fills with ill-tempered scorpions that taunt me about my failed romantic relationships. #JustAnotherDayAsAComputerScientist
There are a lot of reasons why there aren‚Äôt more blacks in CS. I think that CS and STEM jobs are viewed positively in the black community. However, I think that the lack of African American role models is discouraging to black kids who might be thinking about a career in technology. I think that teachers and professors (often well-intentioned ones!) can implicitly or explicitly discourage ethnic minorities from STEM careers. There‚Äôs also an issue of social capital. A lot of stuff gets done in this world via social connections---you know a person who knows a person who helps you to get a job, or a conversation with an important person. If you‚Äôre the first person in your family to go to college, or you‚Äôre the first person to enter a STEM field, or if you went to a school whose alumni aren‚Äôt well-connected to important social networks, it can be more difficult for you to achieve some of your career goals. To be clear, it‚Äôs not impossible! I don‚Äôt want to discourage people from underrepresented groups to get into STEM fields. What I‚Äôm saying is that you will need to be more intentional about achieving your goals. When you attend classes, or go to conferences, or go to job interviews, you‚Äôll need to be focused and prepared. You‚Äôve got to do well academically, but you also have to be good at networking among your peers; I‚Äôd venture that this is just as important as the academic part. You need to be comfortable talking to people, not just about technical subjects, but about everyday things. You‚Äôd be surprised how many ‚Äútechnical‚Äù decisions about who to hire and which projects to pursue are ultimately driven by the ability of people to explain themselves and interact well with others. The only way to get better is to practice!
Finally, I‚Äôll say that you can‚Äôt be afraid to have mentors who are different than you. This is true for everyone. If you‚Äôre a white guy, don‚Äôt be afraid to have a female mentor. If you‚Äôre a black female, don‚Äôt be afraid to have a white man as a mentor. There may be some cultural misunderstandings, but that‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôve got to learn how to deal with those things anyway, so don‚Äôt be afraid of it. I can say with total confidence that the extent to which I‚Äôve been successful in my career is the extent to which key mentors have taken a chance on me and put me in positions where I could succeed. This was true in grad school, this was true at Microsoft, and this was true at MIT.
Some of my favorite teaching moments are when students try to trick me into revealing the answers to test questions or homework assignments. They‚Äôll stop by office hours, and say things like, ‚ÄúI was thinking about solving the project this way, or another way. What do you think about those two ways? BE AS DETAILED AS POSSIBLE.‚Äù I‚Äôll say something noble and principled that involves deep scientific theories and the relationship of mankind to the universe. I will then wait for spontaneous applause. The applause never arrives. Instead, the student will say, ‚ÄúSo, if I did the first thing, would I get a compiler error? If so, where should the semicolon go? BE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE ABOUT WHERE THE SEMICOLON SHOULD GO.‚Äù I‚Äôll mention that learning the positions of semicolons is a key pedagogical goal for the class. They‚Äôll look at me with a smile that says, ‚ÄúWell played, old man.‚Äù Then they‚Äôll slink away and do a Snapchat or whatever it is that occupies young minds these days.
In all seriousness, I‚Äôve really enjoying teaching at MIT. As a whole, the students are quite good. However, I will say that there are a surprisingly large number of MIT students who wear capes. Like, the vast majority of students don‚Äôt wear capes, but I have seen more than one student wearing a cape. Not a superhero cape, but a regular cape. The cape people also tend to eschew normal shirts, and wear some kind of loose-fitting elf jerkin. It‚Äôs strange, but I‚Äôm glad that they are protecting me from the things that only be-caped people can defend against.
Yeah, it‚Äôs definitely a tricky problem! I think that in STEM fields (and computer science in particular), conversations that are ostensibly about scientific things are often driven by people who have the most aggressive personalities. This works to the detriment of people who are naturally quieter or more collaborative. It also works to the detriment of people from underrepresented groups whose voices tend not to be given the automatic authority that is granted to someone from a majority group.
Personally speaking, if I‚Äôm in a group dynamic in which I don‚Äôt know people, or in which I know people but those people won‚Äôt necessarily give me technical respect, I devote 95% of my comments to technical material. I tell very few jokes. I know what you mean about how this can feel like you‚Äôre suppressing an important part of your personality, but it‚Äôs important to be taken seriously among your peers. Once you‚Äôve established your technical chops, you can open up more, but I do think that it‚Äôs important to establish that technical authority early. I can think of specific individuals for which I did not do this, and for whom I then had to devote extra effort to convincing them that I was a serious researcher.
Another important thing is to be prepared for meetings. Have concrete things that you want to talk about, and know how those things relate to what other people will say. It can be difficult to be confident if you‚Äôre improvising, particularly if you‚Äôre improvising about technical things! Also, if you prepare what you want to say, and people try to cut you off, you can say, ‚Äúone second---I just want to describe X, Y, and Z, which relates to the larger group goals in ways A, B, and C.‚Äù It takes practice to be firm about this, but it‚Äôs an investment that will pay off. You don‚Äôt want to be in the habit of getting talked over at meetings. You don‚Äôt need to dominate every meeting, but you want to establish a reputation as a serious thinker. Only then will the ‚Äúsofter‚Äù sides of your personality be perceived as compliments instead of the only thing that you‚Äôre known for.
That being said, I do encourage you to work your personality into your research and into your presentations! I do think that people reward communication which is seen as authentic and enthusiastic. However, you have to know your audience, and you have to be able to tweak your presentation in real time based on how your audience is responding. It‚Äôs particularly important to do this adjustment if you‚Äôre trying to be funny, since comedy can spiral out-of-control very quickly :-).
My final piece of advice is that you can‚Äôt please everyone. Some people like dry but technically competent talks; some people doze off during such presentations. Some people like more humorous presentations, but other people think that the comedy distracts from the core technical message. Personally speaking, I have an explicit non-goal of pleasing everyone. When I prepare for a meeting or a presentation, my goal is to present technical material as clearly as possible while indicating that I have fun when I do technical research. If some people don‚Äôt like it, then that‚Äôs the way it has to be :-).
Thanks for the question! You‚Äôre right that audiences arrive at my presentations with a dual expectation of hearing technical information and also comedic stuff. On the one hand, I like that I‚Äôve been able to build high expectations for my talks---presumably this means that I‚Äôm doing something right :-). However, it can be stressful. In particular, I am always incredibly nervous before a talk; I prefer to be alone so that I can gather my thoughts, or run through the slides one last time. This can be surprising to people who expect that I have meth-user levels of energy at all times. People will often come up to me before a talk and want to chat about transient, light-hearted events from their life, and I tolerate this because I‚Äôm a wonderful person, but inside my head, I‚Äôm like, I AM DYING AND YOU ARE THE PERSON WHO IS KILLING ME. During the presentation itself, I‚Äôm too preoccupied with the mechanics of presenting to be worried, and I really enjoy playing off the crowd reactions as the presentation unfolds. However, those five minutes leading up to the presentation are pure nightmare.
With respect to coming up with particular jokes for particular technical topics, it‚Äôs both easy and hard. I generally don‚Äôt have a problem with devising something ridiculous to say about a random topic---the difficult thing is making that stuff funny in the context of a monologue instead of a dialogue. When you talk to someone in a normal conversation, you can riff off of their responses, and adjust what you‚Äôre saying to match their tone. In contrast, when you do a PowerPoint presentation, you go to war with the army that you have, not the one that you might discover that you should have brought half-way through the presentation. So, for me, it‚Äôs much more difficult to make a funny presentation about JavaScript than it is to have a funny conversation about JavaScript. When I make a presentation, I have to make sure that there‚Äôs a narrative flow, and that the slides mesh well with the words that I‚Äôm saying. I also work very hard on the specific phrasing of my words, because people are less tolerant of poor phrasing in prepared remarks, and a lot of jokes will fail if you don't nail the cadence.
I estimate that I spend 15‚Äî20 hours on a single presentation. This time commitment is a major reason why I sometimes decline speaking opportunities, even though (despite my initial stage fright) I like to give presentations. I wish that I could discover a way to condense my creative process, but I‚Äôve been unsuccessful so far. I think that one reason that people enjoy my presentations is that they have a lot of content---I pack a lot of jokes and a lot of technical material into a short amount of time. This requires a lot of premeditation :-).
I didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job until I got out of grad school. During my time at Georgia Tech, I was a teaching assistant for the introductory computer science class, and during my time as a PhD student, I did two internships at Microsoft Research (one in the Redmond lab, and one in the Cambridge UK lab). When I graduated from Michigan in 2008, I went directly to work at MSR as a researcher in the Distributed Systems group.
In retrospect, I wish that I had done an internship or two as an undergraduate. I also wish that I had done more research as an undergraduate. Industry experience and research experience are two things that you can't get purely by reading books and taking classes :-).
I have many fond memories of working with Brian. My fondest memory is how he didn‚Äôt fire me during my first two years of graduate school, even though I was fairly ridiculous and I didn‚Äôt know much about the process of doing good research. My favorite project with Brian in terms of research was our work on predicting host availability in distributed systems. I think that we dealt with an interesting and important technical problem, and our NSDI paper later became the core of my dissertation. Another favorite project was a kernel hacking project in which I was trying to modify the Linux networking stack. I was deep in the guts of the beast, trying to understand a bunch of asynchronous interrupt insanity, and Brian came to my office one day and asked ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going?‚Äù, and I looked at him with sad eyes and simply said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the kernel,‚Äù and we both knew that, if I survived, a boy would become a man.
My public opinion on passwords is that yes, they will definitely go away, because I believe in the relentless march of progress in the face of impossible odds. My private, deeply-held view is that passwords are unlikely to go away, because it seems like they are the least terrible thing in a horrifically bad solution space. For example, biometrics seem amazing until you realize that they‚Äôre easy to spoof and that, once someone has stolen your iris signature, it‚Äôs fairly difficult for you to get a new iris. Hardware-based authentication tokens seem promising, except for the fact that I am absolutely not going to carry a hardware-based authentication token. So, maybe I could use my smartphone as an authentication token, even though it‚Äôs crawling with random apps that have all the permissions because I gave them all the permissions because it seems reasonable for Flappy Bird to have access to my network, my front-facing camera, and my back-facing camera. So, uh, maybe passwords will have to suffice :-).
Regarding PGP, I get exhausted when I think about it. It‚Äôs a good idea in theory, but key-signing parties are too nerdy for me to get into, even though I‚Äôve watched the new ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù trailer 71 times and I have often wished that I could live in the ‚ÄúBlade Runner‚Äù world even though that world is filled with rain and evil androids and cryptic origamis that hint at poignant truths just beyond the edge of reason. When someone proposes that we exchange email using PGP, I‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll send you that email soon!‚Äù, but with 100% likelihood I will never send that email, because I get an autoimmune disease when I think about all of the things that would have to change in my life for that PGP email to actually get sent. I think that people who only receive PGP emails are only talking to PGP people; those emails probably use some kind of secret patois in which all verb conjugations involve the awkward exchange of megabytes of Base64-encoded data. Thanks but no thanks! I see the tortoise on its back; I do not think I‚Äôll help it.
I‚Äôve encountered many horrible bugs. One of the more frustrating ones involved a system that I built for speculative execution in JavaScript code. Basically, my system would create a copy of a web page‚Äôs JavaScript state, guess an action that the user might do (like clicking a button), and then update the speculative copy of the page with the results of the speculated action. Later, if the user actually performed that action, the browser could immediately commit the speculative copy of the state instead of waiting for networking calls to complete, and for rendering to finish, and so on. Debugging that system was a pure nightmare, because, at any given moment, I had multiple versions of reality lying around. Every variable would have different, ominous copies that were just lurking and waiting to mess up my jam. At one point, I built a custom debugging library, but when I launched it, my system made multiple copies of it too. The whole experience was awful. The ultimate cause of the bug was that I forgot a ‚Äúvar‚Äù statement inside of a function declaration, meaning that a variable that I thought was function-local was actually a global variable that was being reused across different function invocations. So petty. So infuriating.
I have two separate bands because I don‚Äôt have the time to have three separate bands. Being in just a single one-man band is quite demanding---you are responsible not only for writing and playing all of the music, but for destroying hotel rooms, showing up three hours late for concerts, and crashing expensive cars that you bought just the other day. As you can imagine, it can be a frustrating and lonely venture to do all of this by yourself. However, I am confident that, in the near future, I will have a third band whose internal politics may or may not cause one of the first two bands to break-up.
Learning how to do good research was a big challenge, and it‚Äôs still something that I try to improve. After I got out of undergrad, I had this mistaken idea that ‚Äúresearch‚Äù was just ‚Äúapplied programming‚Äù: I could think of an idea for an awesome program, and then I‚Äôd build that program, and then I‚Äôd tell people what I built, and then I‚ÄôM FAMOUS YO. This is not what research is :-). Research is about proposing interesting questions, or identifying important real-world problems, and then exploring the implications of those questions or those problems. Along the way, you may happen to write some code. Indeed, if you do systems research, you‚Äôll probably write a lot of code. However, the code is generally not the most interesting thing‚Äîthe most interesting thing is the problem that you decided to attack, and the solution that you devised.
It‚Äôs difficult to learn how to ask good questions. One reason is that good questions often require a strong understanding of the preexisting scientific literature, and none of us are born with that knowledge. This problem gets better with time, assuming that you keep track of the latest results in your field. A more tricky obstacle to asking good questions is that you have to adopt a philosophical perspective that is a bit unnatural. You have to be able to ignore superfluous details and be able to distill the essence of current solutions; what‚Äôs good about them, and what‚Äôs bad? You have to be able to relentlessly discard your own ideas if you find them to be lacking, and you have to frequently question your ideas even if they seem good. You also have to be able to figure out ways to actually answer the questions that you posed. This is trickier than it might seem, since the world makes it difficult to prove things :-).
So, learning how to pose questions (and then answer them in a convincing manner) has been the biggest intellectual challenge that I‚Äôve experienced in my career as a researcher. I‚Äôve been lucky to work with brilliant minds at MSR and MIT, and I‚Äôm extremely grateful for that. As I mentioned in an answer to another question, the greatest thing that you can do for your intellectual growth is to expose yourself to people who are smarter than you, and who will engage you and challenge your ideas. It‚Äôs painful, but it‚Äôs worthwhile.
With respect to challenges that arose from being a member of an underrepresented group, I think that there were two main challenges. First, I had to shed the self-consciousness of being in meetings where I would be the only person of color. Second, I had to ensure that, at those meetings, my voice was heard. To do the latter, I did my homework: I always came to meetings prepared; I read books about body language and how to make effective presentations; and, in situations where I thought that I was being unfairly talked-over, I made a personal policy that I would firmly (but politely) insist that I needed to finish what I was saying. By learning how to stand up for myself in meetings and communicate effectively, I was able to get rid of the self-consciousness, since those feelings only emerged when I felt like I was not being an active member of the group.
Thanks for the question---it‚Äôs an interesting one! I think that computer science is pretty amenable to independent research. If you have a laptop or desktop, you can develop and test code; if you have access to Azure or EC2, you can run distributed experiments. Many computer science conferences have double-blind reviewing, meaning that, if you submit a research paper, nobody will know that you lack traditional research credentials. Source repositories like GitHub also make it easy to share your code with others. So, there are a lot of ways to get your results to the public. You asked ‚Äúif this is so easy, why aren‚Äôt more people doing it?‚Äù The answer is that doing research is not easy, even if it‚Äôs relatively easy to get access to the tools :-).
Despite the existence of things like GitHub and EC2, it‚Äôs true that the vast majority of basic research is done by universities and industrial labs, not by individuals. I think that there are several reasons for this. First, there are network effects to doing basic research alongside other basic researchers---the cross-pollination of ideas is a force multiplier. Second, there‚Äôs a formal aspect to doing research. For example, identifying good research problems is a skill that must be learned and practiced. As another example, there are best practices for running experiments that prove what you want them to prove. PhD programs try to teach those skills, and basic research often emerges from groups of people with PhDs. So, depending on what kind of career you want, working in a university or industrial research lab may be your best bet for getting paid to do basic research.
Lionel Ritchie is always here. He never sleeps, and his constant, mildly-irritating presence keeps us focused as we struggle to understand JavaScript‚Äôs bizarre semantics.
Growing up, my role models were not associated with a particular career that I wanted. Instead, my role models were people who had personal characteristics that I admired and that I wanted to emulate. For example, my mother is an important role model for me, because she‚Äôs very compassionate but incredibly tough. She doesn‚Äôt complain when life is difficult, and she is fiercely loyal to the people that she loves. I respect this immensely, and I try to be like this as well. As I‚Äôve gotten older, I‚Äôve grown to appreciate the virtues of toughness, and the importance of maintaining emotional balance in good times and bad times.
Once I got interested in research, I discovered a variety of role models in computer science, and I‚Äôve been lucky enough to work alongside some of them (e.g., Bill Bolosky at MSR, Frans Kaashoek at MIT). One of my favorite parts of being alive is watching how people think. I‚Äôm continually fascinated by how people interpret and question the world, and I spend a lot of time trying to understand how people like Bill and Frans think. Once I discover the secret, I will obviously tell no one so that I can maintain my competitive advantage. However, I obviously digress.
Comedians are another class of role model for me. In particular, I‚Äôm really inspired by Louis C.K. I didn‚Äôt use the word ‚Äúinspired‚Äù lightly‚Äîthat‚Äôs the exact word that I intended to use. I think that he‚Äôs the closest thing society has to a comedic genius. His ability to mix comedy with dark subject matter is amazing, and I love his storytelling style‚Äîhis body language, his vocal cadence, his sentence structure. This paragraph has become a love letter to Louis C.K., so I‚Äôm going to stop it now before I start dotting my i's with hearts.
I also have role models who are authors. Chuck Klosterman is a favorite, along with Kurt Vonnegut and Ta-Nehisi Coates (whose ideas I don‚Äôt always agree with, but whose writing style I want to eat so that I can absorb its powers).
Umm (nervous laughter), you see (starts to fidget uncomfortably) . . :-). I think that I had a paper that was rejected five times before getting accepted. This, uh, is not the common case for me, but it happens to the best of us. There‚Äôs a large amount of noise in the reviewing process; I‚Äôve seen this as a member of program committees. When you look at the complete batch of papers that are submitted to a conference, there are basically 10% which are atrocious and which will never get into Readers‚Äô Digest; there are 5% which are golden and which are slam-dunks for acceptance; and then there‚Äôs a bell-curve of quality in-between. As a researcher, you hope that your papers will always be in the 5% golden category, but more realistically, the only thing that it‚Äôs realistic to strive for is to be in the top quartile. For all of its warts, the peer review system does a pretty good job in improving papers (and I think that many papers in the 5% golden category have been sharpened by previous reject-and-revise cycles). It‚Äôs frustrating to have your papers rejected, but good work usually gets published eventually.
I guess that I introduced myself to computer science :-). As a teenager, I knew that I wanted to have some kind of career in science or engineering, and when I got to Georgia Tech as an undergrad, I declared myself a CS major, figuring that I could switch later if I didn‚Äôt like it. As it turns out, I never switched! However, there was no specific person who encouraged me to go into computer science. In retrospect, I do wish that I had been exposed to computer science more often as a child. I did goof around with computers as a kid, and I enjoyed surfing the web and playing video games and what not. However, I didn‚Äôt really understand the importance of algorithms and software engineering until I got to college.
There are several reasons why I stuck with CS. First of all, I like solving problems, and I like building things. Computer science gives me the opportunity to do both. I also think that computer science acts as a force multiplier for other human endeavors. For example, distributed computation allows physicists to simulate the weather, and Amazon to keep track of customer orders, and Facebook to inform my ridiculous friends about the ridiculous things that I myself am doing. I enjoy working in a field which can potentially help so many people!

Does your group have a yearly conference? If not, you might consider having one. I say this because face-to-face interactions are extremely important for spinning up collaborations and long-term discussions. I realize that organizing a conference is a very complex endeavor, but I think that conferences really help to create a sense of community in a way that online discussions alone cannot. Conferences also help with professional networking, which is extremely important for one‚Äôs ultimate career success. If having a full-blown conference is infeasible, you may be able to co-locate a workshop alongside a bigger, preexisting tech conference. Alternatively, you might be able to offer travel scholarships for BIT members to go to conferences as a group; as you know, conferences are super-expensive, so any kind of financial support can lower the barrier to participation for POC. In summary, anything that gets people in the same room is useful for building community!
